  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Install personal firewalls on mobile and/or employee-owned computers used to access the company network. Configure mobile and/or employee-owned computers used to access the company network to company standards.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A compromised personal computer is a threat to the cardholder data environment. A personal firewall offers some protection from network attacks and may prevent remote control malware from working.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Install and configure a personal firewall on each mobile and/or employee-owned computer used to access the company network. On recent Windows operating systems, the built-in firewall may be used to meet this requirement. Use a group policy to prevent the
 employee from disabling the firewall or changing the firewall settings.</p>
