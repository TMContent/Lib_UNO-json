<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Protect each Internet connection with a firewall.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Allowing unfiltered Internet access to the network gives attackers more opportunities to exploit potential vulnerabilities and to control potentially compromised systems remotely.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If an Internet connection is not secured by a firewall, install and configure a firewall on that Internet connection. Update the security policy to include the requirement that there be a firewall at each internet connection. Update the network diagram to
 include any new firewalls.</p>
