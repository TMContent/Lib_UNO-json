  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Encrypt configuration sections that contain sensitive data such as SQL connection strings. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Configuration sections typically contain privacy sensitive resource access credentials (e.g., a connection string for a SQL server resource includes a username and password.) As a precautionary measure, they should not be stored in plaintext, because an attacker that can compromise a server will be able to read those values if they are not adequately protected.&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This guideline is applicable whenever configuration sections are utilized. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;Use DPAPI to encrypt the sensitive data in the configuration file on your WCF server machine. </p>
  <p>To encrypt the &lt;connectionStrings&gt; section by using the DPAPI provider with the machine-key store (the default configuration), run the following command from a command window:</p>
  <pre>aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/MachineDPAPI" -prov "DataProtectionConfigurationProvider"</pre>
  <p>The aspnet_regiis options are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>-pe: Specifies the configuration section to encrypt.<li>-app: Specifies your Web application's virtual path. If your application is nested, you need to specify the nested path from the root directory; for example, "/test/aspnet/MachineDPAPI".<li>-prov: Specifies the provider name.</li></li></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: If you need to encrypt configuration file data on multiple servers in a Web farm, use the RSA protected configuration provider because of the ease with which you can export RSA key containers.<br /></p>
