  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Make sure that authentication and authorization policies are configurable.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The authentication and authorization policies should be configurable to make it possible for the users to adapt the application to their environment.</p>
  <h1>How To Check</h1>
  <p>To make sure that authentication and authorization policies are configurable:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify application requirements.</strong> Define options for configuring access control and authentication policies. At the very least, there should be an administration panel for managing user accounts and global application settings, and a page for users to manage their own accounts. ASP.NET provides the <em>Roles</em> API for managing role-based authorization.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify administrative pages. </strong>Find the administration interface that is used to configure authentication and authorization policies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review the administration interface.</strong> Test the functionality of the administration interface to make sure it satisfies the application requirements.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How To Fix</h1>
  <p>To implement authentication and authorization administration:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify application requirements.</strong> Define options for configuring access control and authentication policies. At the very least, there should be an administration panel for managing user accounts, and a page for users to manage their own accounts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Make authentication and authorization code configurable.</strong> Find all code responsible for authentication and authorization features. Modify this code to read settings defined in the application requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Design the administrative pages.</strong> Design the pages to be used for configuring access control and authentication policies based on the requirements for your application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Implement the administration interface.</strong> Write code for the administrative pages to interface with authentication and authorization code. The administration interface should be able to read and write settings to a secure location, where the authentication and authorization code may access them. The saved settings should be protected with access controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure and tampering.</p>
    </li>
