<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> Android</li>
</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>If you need to restrict access to an instance of <em>AccountManager</em> that uses OAuth 2 to authenticate with a cloud-based service, use the method <em>getPackageManager().checkSignatures(UID1, UID2)</em> to test whether the signature for one package (UID1) is the same as another (UID2).
</p><h2>Why</h2><p><em>AccountManager</em> allows a user account to access cloud-based services through the OAuth 2 protocol. Restrict this access to certain applications if the cloud service contains sensitive information or requires a special subscription.
</p><h2>When</h2><p>Perform this check for applications that implement a service that uses <em>AccountManager</em> and OAuth2 for cloud-based authentication.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>Prior to calling the <em>getAuthToken()</em> method which will retrieve the authentication token for accessing into a cloud service:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Determine the packages for which you are authorizing access.</strong> Retrieve their user ID (UID) with a call to <em>Binder.getCallingUid()</em>. Take special care to call this method from within the application itself, and store the UIDs in a location accessible from the service.</li>
<li> <strong>When a bound service invokes a method in your application, capture the UID of the calling service.</strong> Doing so can be tricky, as many programmers do this in the <em>onBind()</em> method of the application’s service, thinking that the <em>Binder.getCallingUid()</em> method will return the remote process UID. (It does not, because <em>onBind()</em> is not remotely called.) Instead, place this call in an Android Interface Definition Language remotely accessible service, or override the <em>sendMessageAtTime(Message m, long l)</em> method in your bound service’s handler instance to obtain the calling UID.</li>
<li> <strong>Validate the UID.</strong> Check the UID against those you have used <em>getPackageManager().checkSignatures(UID1, UID2)</em> to authorize. Use the return to decide whether the remote application should be allowed access.  The return is &amp;gt;= 0 if the signatures match or &amp;lt; 0 if they do not.  </li>
</ol><h2>Problem Example</h2><p>As the MyApp developer, you are using a cloud service to access Google application programming interfaces (APIs). You configure your Android applications to automatically bind to the service and use <em>AccountManager</em> to generate a token and log in to the API service.
</p><p>
All works flawlessly, but you discover that other applications can piggyback on your service with a few lines of code:
</p><pre>ServiceConnection connection = new MonitoringServiceConnection();

intent.setAction("com.example.myapp.REGISTER ");
	context.bindService(intent, connection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);

class MonitoringServiceConnection implements ServiceConnection {	
public void onServiceConnected (ComponentName className, IBinder binder)
{
	messengerToService = new Messenger(binder);
}
	
public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className) {
		messengerToService = null; 
}
};
</pre><p>
The <em>onBind()</em> method of the MyApp service contains a call to <em>getAuthToken()</em>, which starts the authentication process to your cloud-based service using <em>AccountManager</em>:
</p><pre>Account account = new Account("myapp@gmail.com", "com.google");
am.getAuthToken(account, "Manage your tasks”, null,  ref, new GetAuthCallback(), handler);    
</pre><p>
You want to limit access to your service if for no other reason than to require a subscription. Allowing anyone to bind freely and access the service will not work.
</p>
<h2>Solution Example</h2><p>To authenticate application access to the MyApp service, you can first capture the sending application’s UID by overriding the <em>sendMessageAtTime()</em> method in the handler instance for the bound service. In this method, call <em>int uid = Binder.getCallingUid()</em>. Next, add a call to <em>checkSignatures()</em> with this UID and the one that is authorized access. If the <em>checkSignatures()</em> method does not return a match (&amp;lt;0), set the incoming message’s <em>arg1</em> field  = -1, and use this in the next method to determine whether this message should be accepted:
</p><pre>@Override 
public boolean sendMessageAtTime(Message incoming, long l) {
int uid = Binder.getCallingUid();
if (getPackageManager().checkSignatures(uid, 10514)&amp;lt;=0) {
incoming.arg1=-1;
}
else {
incoming.arg1=1;
handleMessage(incoming);
}
return true;
}
</pre><p>
This case assumes that the authorized UID is 10514 and was recorded in the <em>onCreate</em> method of the service with a call to <em>Binder.getCallingUid()</em>. If other UIDs are also allowed access, you will need to call the <em>Binder.getCallingUid()</em> method from those applications and store the UID in a persistent location. Of course, use the <em>checkSignatures</em> method for these, as well.
</p><p>
The <em>arg1</em> field tells you if the message from the recipient should be accepted. Update the handler’s <em>handleMessage()</em> method with logic to look for the incoming message’s <em>arg1</em> field. If it is set to -1, reject the message with a simple return. Otherwise, let the application interact with the service and use the <em>AccountManager</em>:
</p><pre>@Override
public void handleMessage(Message incoming) {	
if (incoming.arg1==-1){return;}
}

… //continue processing AccountManager token request
</pre>
