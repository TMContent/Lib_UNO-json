<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that your application avoids serializing the fields in the classes that contain the sensitive data.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Either implement <b>ISerializable</b> to control the serialization behavior or decorate fields that contain sensitive data with the &#91;<b>NonSerialized</b>&#93; attribute. By default, all private and public fields are serialized. This is important because serialization places the data in memory, often in preparation for sending it over a network, making it easier for an attacker to gain access to it.</p>
  <p>The following example shows how to use the <b>&#91;NonSerialized&#93;</b> attribute to ensure that a specific field which contains sensitive data cannot be serialized.</p>
  <div>
    <pre> &#91;Serializable&#93;public class Employee<br /> &#123;<br />  // OK for name to be serialized  private string name;<br />  // Prevent salary being serialized<br /> &#91;NonSerialized&#93;<br /> private double annualSalary;<br />  . . .<br />&#125;</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Alternatively, implement the <b>ISerializable</b> interface and explicitly control the serialization process. If you must serialize the sensitive item or items of data, consider encrypting the data first. The code that de-serializes your object must have access to the decryption key.</p>
