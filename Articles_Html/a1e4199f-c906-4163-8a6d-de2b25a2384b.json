      "Content spoofing vulnerabilities occur when the application can be manipulated to display malicious content injected by the attacker. This is a very broad vulnerability class that can have multiple causes. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can result in content spoofing, and cross-site scripting is itself a broad vulnerability class. Content spoofing can also result from poor authentication controls that allow the attacker to substitute application data with malicious data.",
      "It is not necessary for the attacker to compromise the application â€“ content spoofing is in the eye of the beholder; so long as the user sees the attacker's content and thinks it is coming from the application, content spoofing is taking place.",
