  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Consider what binding options you have and which makes sense for your scenario.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Choosing an appropriate binding is important from security perspective as it drives your security choices like transfer security which determines your confidentiality, integrity and authentication of the messages.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>The key issues to consider at design time are what bindings you will choose for your particular scenario. Additionally you need to consider what authentication and authorizations options you have and which makes sense for your scenario.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Know your binding options and choose the most appropriate for your scenario. Knowing your binding options enables you to design more reliable and secure WCF application. </p>
  <p>The following table summarizes common bindings:</p>

          <td>It represents a bindings that configures and expose endpoints that are able to communicate with ASMX-based Web services and clients and other services that conform to the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1. By defaults it has security disabled.</td>

          <td>wsHttpBinding&nbsp;</td>
          <td>Defines a secure, reliable, interoperable binding suitable for non-duplex service contracts. The binding implements the following specifications: WS-Reliable Messaging for reliability, and WS-Security for message security and authentication. The transport is HTTP, and message encoding is Text/XML encoding. By default it provides message security with windows authentication.</td>

          <td>Defines a secure, reliable, interoperable binding suitable for non-duplex service contracts. The binding implements the following specifications: WS-Reliable Messaging for reliability, and WS-Security for message security and authentication. The transport is HTTP, and message encoding is Text/XML encoding. The ws2007HttpBinding provides binding similar to wsHttpBinding but uses the standard for OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards). By default it provides message security with windows authentication.</td>

It uses TCP protocol for message delivery, and binary message encoding.</td>

It helps implementing Federation which is the ability to flow and share identities across multiple enterprises or trust domains for authentication and authorization. WCF implements federation over message and mixed mode security but not over transport security. Services configured with this binding must use the HTTP protocol as transport</td>
