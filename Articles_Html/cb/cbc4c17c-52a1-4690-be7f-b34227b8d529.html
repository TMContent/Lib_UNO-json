<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 10.1</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Logging should be enabled. A centralized log server should be deployed.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Logging helps detect an attack in progress, coordinate a response, and investigate the attack afterwards.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Locate and examine the centralized log server to verify that it is operational. Examine the logs to verify that they are current.&amp;nbsp;Interview the system administrator to verify that all system components are included in the logs.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Choose a centralized log server solution. When choosing a centralized log server solution, it may be helpful to verify that it is explicitly designed to satisfy PCI DSS Requirement 10.2.2 - logging all activity by the administrator and the other privileged
 users - because this functionality is difficult to implement otherwise. Install and configure a centralized log server by following the vendor's instructions. Configure all network devices that are compatible with the log server to send logs to the log server.
 Make a list of the incompatible devices and use this list daily to manually check and backup the corresponding logs. Consider replacing the devices that are not compatible with ones that are.</p>
