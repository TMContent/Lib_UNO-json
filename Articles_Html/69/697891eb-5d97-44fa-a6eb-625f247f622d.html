<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>Applications written using Servlets or JSP that interact with a database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Apply the principle of least privilege to any accounts used by the application to access the backend database server.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Applying the principle of least privilege to all of the application's database accounts reduces the damage potential if such accounts get compromised by an attacker.</p>
<h2>When</h2>
<p>Apply least privileges any time your application uses a backend database server.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>To apply the principle of least privilege to the application's database accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify all database accounts.</strong> Create a list of all of your application's database accounts and the respective servers and databases that they connect to.</li>
<li><strong>Identify the roles associated with each database account.</strong> Understand the purpose of each account and the functionality each will be executing. Using a table, map all accounts to the minimum privileges they require. None of the application's accounts should have administrative rights on the database server.</li>
<li><strong>Set appropriate privileges.</strong> Once all accounts and their roles have been identified, set the appropriate privileges at the respective database servers. Make sure that each account has enough privileges to execute the assigned tasks only. Any extra privileges should be revoked.</li>
</ol>
