<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft&#174; Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) 3.5 <li>Microsoft Visual Studio&#174; 2008</li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Consider using basicHttpBinding in your service,&nbsp;when you have ASMX client base.&nbsp; </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>BasicHttpbinding is a flexible way to provide support for the existing legacy clients, because it does not require upgrading them to WCF. Additionally basicHttpbinding provides a wide range of authentication schemes. Transport security supports basic, digest, windows and certificate authentication; message security supports username and certificate authentication</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If you have ASMX client base, consider using basicHttpBinding in your service, because it&nbsp; can be consumed by both WCF and legacy&nbsp;clients.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To use basicHttpBinding, create an endpoint, with binding configuration to use basicHttBinding. Security mode is turned off by default. To enable security and authentication you will need to create a binding configuration and configure the endpoint to use it.</p>
