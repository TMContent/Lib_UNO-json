<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 8.7 </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Require authentication for database access.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Preventing the database access accounts used by applications from being used interactively or by other processes ensures that if these accounts are compromised, an attacker cannot use them.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that database access is authenticated:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Implement functionality to authenticate data access.</strong> Program the database application to present the user with a login screen, where the user has to be authenticated before being granted access to the information in the database. Use the
 authentication credentials from the login throughout the database application to implement access control.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the database administration interface.</strong> Allow only the database administrators to access to the database administration interface(s). Usually a database server allows either a terminal session or a visual administration application
 to connect to a port and issue SQL queries directly. Authentication credentials usually secure this functionality. Do not make access credentials available for any other users besides the database administrator(s).
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the database files. </strong>To prevent direct access to the database files, use the access control system implemented by the host Operating System to allow access to database administrator(s) only. If possible, block any computer, besides
 the administrator's workstation, from accessing the database server administration interface by using a white list. A white list is a list of hosts that are exclusively allowed to access some functionality. On UNIX-style systems, white lists are usually configured
 by editing the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Log access to cardholder data.</strong> Instrument the application to log access to the cardholder data. Send the logs to the centralized log server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Protect the database access credentials used by applications.</strong> Allow the access credentials used by the database application to be used by that application only. Do not allow these credentials to be used by users or other processes. This
 is best accomplished by web applications. If you use a web application, you can configure the database server to use a white list. A white list is a list of hosts that are exclusively allowed to access some functionality while rejecting all access that does
 not originate from the web application server. On UNIX-style systems, white lists are usually configured by editing the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files. If you donâ€™t use a web application and the client application connects directly to the database
 server, control the interface used by the application to connect to the database. If a database application does not comply with these requirements, the database application will have to be rewritten and possibly redesigned. Considering the costs of redesigning,
 rewriting and redeploying database applications, it is recommended to consult an expert as early in the design stages as possible to make sure that the resulting application is PCI DSS compliant. Security Innovation offers professional application development
