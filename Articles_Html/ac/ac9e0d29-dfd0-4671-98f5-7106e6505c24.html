<h1>Description</h1><p>An insufficiently protected credential weakness occurs when the application doesn't store or transmit the authentication credentials securely. If the passwords are not hashed and salted, an attacker may be able to recover stored passwords after compromising the application. If the passwords or hashes are not encrypted during transmission, an attacker may be able to intercept passwords or hashes vis a man-in-the-middle attack. All applications that use authentication are affected by this vulnerability type. 
</p><h1>Impact</h1><p>An insufficiently protected credential vulnerability makes it easier for an attacker to gain access to the authentication credentials. Usually, some other vulnerability has to be present for the attacker to recover the credentials. Once the attacker has the credentials, he can impersonate the user whose credentials have been compromised. Malicious hackers usually target privileged accounts to take over the application. After taking over the application, an attacker may leverage other vulnerabilities to take over the application platform and use it to pivot for other attacks. Compromising the application also gives the attacker access to user data, thus enabling him to impersonate the user. 
</p><h1>Countermeasures</h1><p>To prevent this vulnerability type, use PBKDF2 to secure passwords and send authentication credentials over encrypted tunnels. 
</p><p>
Hash and salt passwords:</p><ul>
<li> <a href="6e0918c1-90db-46d5-9f0e-8a98ddbcd7d5">Store Passwords Securely</a></li>
<li> <a href="bcf8adb4-8186-4b97-b490-4fa33f506bfd">Limit Access to the Credential Store</a></li>
</ul><h1>Application Check</h1><p>To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability type, verify that PBKDF2 is used to secure passwords and that authentication credentials are never sent in plain-text. 
</p><p>
Passwords are hashed and salted for storage using PBKDF2:</p><ul>
<li> <a href="d74fe6bf-387f-4ff1-9edb-d0275eedffc0">Passwords Are Stored Securely</a></li>
<li> <a href="9031f577-80b0-4a2e-9652-7b470439a0df">Access to the Credential Store Is Limited</a></li>

</p><h2>Fundamentals of Application Security</h2><p>This two-part course is ideal for security and development practitioners that want to understand software security risk and seek specific implementation guidance on how to build and deploy more secure software applications.  It starts off describing why software security is critical and the risk that software vulnerabilities represent, and proceeds to lay the foundation for secure software development by presenting specific security controls and principles that development teams can implement immediately to reduce software risk.
