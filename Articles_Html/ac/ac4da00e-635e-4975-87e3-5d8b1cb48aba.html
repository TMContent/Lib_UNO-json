<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>If you need to apply constraints to determine which files or directories an application is able to access, you can use code access security and grant your code a limited permission using the <b>FileIOPermission </b>attribute. If your assembly is strong-named or contains other cryptographically strong evidence, an administrator can configure enterprise or computer-wide code access security policy to grant a restricted <b>FileIOPermission</b> to your assembly. </p>
  <p>You can configure your ASP.NET Web application to run in medium trust to limit file access to the application's virtual directory hierarchy. </p>
