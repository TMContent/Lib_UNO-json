<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>Applications written using Servlets or JSP.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>The following code allows a user to change their credentials. Unfortunately, the code enters the new credentials into the credentials repository without verifying that it is the actual user changing the credentials.</p>
<pre><code>public boolean changePassword(String user, char[] newPass)
{
       // The application fails to re-authenticate the user
       // Verify that new password meets password requirements
       // Update the credential store with the new password
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>The following code allows a user to change their credentials. Before entering the new credentials into the credentials repository, the code verifies that it is the actual user doing the credentials change.</p>
<pre><code>public boolean changePassword(String user, char[] oldPass, char[] newPass)
{
      // The application forces re-authentication
      if(!validateUser(user, oldPass))
      {
            return false;
      }
      // Verify that new password meets password requirements
      // Update the credential store with the new password
}
</code></pre>
