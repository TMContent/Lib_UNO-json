  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that Apache is configured to use only strong TLS ciphers.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using strong encryption algorithms with TLS helps reduce the risk of successful eavesdropping attacks and helps with regulatory compliance.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that Apache is configured to use only strong TLS ciphers, view the <em>httpd.conf</em> files and check the following settings: "<em>SSLProtocol</em>" and "<em>SSLCipherSuite</em>". The recommended settings are:</p>
  <pre>SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1<br />SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2:!MD5:@STRENGTH<br />SSLHonorCipherOrder on</pre>
  <p>These settings enable only the TLS protocol and only the strong encryption cipher suites.</p>
  <p>It may also be a good idea to check for the following line in case of old versions of <em>apache/mod_ssl</em>:</p>
  <pre>SSLInsecureRenegotiation off</pre>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To use only strong TLS algorithms, edit the <em>httpd.conf</em> file to include the following settings:</p>
  <pre>SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1<br />SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2:!MD5:@STRENGTH<br />SSLHonorCipherOrder on</pre>
  <p>These settings enable only the TLS protocol and only the strong encryption cipher suites.</p>
  <p>It may also be a good idea to include the following line in case of old versions of <em>apache/mod_ssl</em>:</p>
  <pre>SSLInsecureRenegotiation off</pre>
