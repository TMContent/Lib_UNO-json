<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use the latest version of TLS on servers that use TLS.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Old versions of SSL have known vulnerabilities. The latest TLS version has addressed these vulnerabilities. New vulnerabilities may be found in the future, requiring a newer version of TLS to be used.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Configure your server to use the latest TLS version with strong cypher suites.</p>
