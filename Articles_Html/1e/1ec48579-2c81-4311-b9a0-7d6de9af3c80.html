  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use the latest version of TLS on servers that use TLS.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Old versions of SSL and TLS have known vulnerabilities in them, which 
makes them unacceptable. The latest version of TLS has addressed these 
vulnerabilities. New vulnerabilities may be found in the future, 
requiring a newer version of TLS to be used.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Configure your application's web server to use the latest version of TLS.</p>
