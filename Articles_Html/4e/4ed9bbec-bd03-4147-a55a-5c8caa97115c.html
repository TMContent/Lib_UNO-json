  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Design and document the key management procedures to require secure key distribution. Include the key management procedures in the information security policy. To qualify, the key management procedures should explain how the keys are distributed and what
 limitations make them secure. One example of a secure key distribution procedure is only distributing the keys on the application server.</p>
