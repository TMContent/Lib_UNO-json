  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that the "<em>Secure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags&amp;nbsp;are set on all sensitive cookies, especially cookies containing session IDs.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <span>
    <p>Set the "<em>Secure</em>" flag on all sensitive cookies to protect the contents of the sensitive cookies from eavesdropping attacks. Setting the "<em>Secure</em>" flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured by TLS. The "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script - this measure helps reduce the potential damage of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>

  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that the "<em>Secure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags are set on all sensitive cookies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that TLS is available.</strong> The "<em>Secure</em>" flag forces cookies to be sent over TLS. TLS has to be available for this to work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive cookies.</strong> Session cookies should always be considered sensitive. Enumerate all cookies used by the application. Make a list of cookies that may contain sensitive information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify code that creates sensitive cookies.</strong> For each sensitive cookie in the list, find the code that creates that cookie.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that the "<em>Secure</em>" and&amp;nbsp;"<em>HTTPOnly</em>"&amp;nbsp;flags are set for each sensitive cookie. </strong>For each piece of code that creates a sensitive cookie, verify that code exists that sets the "<em>Secure</em>" and&amp;nbsp;"<em>HTTPOnly</em>"&amp;nbsp;flags. This code should look like so:</p>
      <pre>Cookie sensitiveCookie = new Cookie(“SessionID”,sessionID);<br />sensitiveCookie.setSecure(true);<br />sensitiveCookie.setHttpOnly(true);</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set the "S<em>ecure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags for each sensitive cookie.</strong> For each piece of code that creates a sensitive cookie, add code that sets the "S<em>ecure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags for the cookie. For example:</p>
      <pre>Cookie sensitiveCookie = new Cookie(“SessionID”,sessionID);<br />sensitiveCookie.setSecure(true);<br />sensitiveCookie.setHttpOnly(true);</pre>
    </li>
