<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The cardholder PIN should never be stored.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The cardholder PIN is used for authentication at ATMs and that makes it of high value to an attacker. In the rare event it is required for a transaction, it should not be stored after the transaction has been processed.
</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the following to make sure that the PIN is not included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incoming transactions </li>
    <li>All logs (transaction, history, debugging, error) </li>
    <li>History files </li>
    <li>Trace files </li>
    <li>Database schemas </li>
    <li>Database contents </li>
    <li>Any other place where cardholder data is stored</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify the storage mechanism that stores the PIN, for example a script or a database query. Change the storage mechanism so that it does not record the PIN.</p>
