<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Application Keys should be stored in a well defined location, such as the encrypted sections of the application's web.config or encrypted in the Windows Registry. Do not hard code them or store them as plaintext inside configuration files.</p>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>The following code shows a hard-coded encryption key inside the application. A determined attacker will be able to compromise the key once they gain access to the source code.</p>
<pre><code>byte[] salt = MyApp.Crypto.GenerateSalt();
string secretString = &quot;application's encryption key&quot;;
HMACSHA512 md = new HMACSHA512(salt);
md.Initialize();
byte[] rawKey =
 md.ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(secretString));
md.Clear();
Rijndael encMD = Rijndael.Create();
encMD.Key = rawKey;
encMD.IV = salt;
ICryptoTransform encCT = encMD.CreateEncryptor();
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>The following code shows an application that securely stores its encryption keys. Because the keys are stored into the Windows Registry and are protected with the ASP.NET's DPAPI encryption keys, it is extremely difficult for an attacker to steal the actual key without compromising the password associated with the ASP.NET local system account.</p>
<pre><code>byte[] salt = MyApp.Crypto.GenerateSalt(); 
RegistryKey regKey =
 Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(&quot;SOFTWARE\\MyApp\\KeyStore&quot;, true);
byte[] rawKey = (byte[])regKey.GetValue(&quot;encKey&quot;, null);
rawKey =
 ProtectedData.Unprotect(rawKey, salt, DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser); 
Rijndael encMD = Rijndael.Create();
encMD.Key = rawKey;
encMD.IV = salt;
ICryptoTransform encCT = encMD.CreateEncryptor();
