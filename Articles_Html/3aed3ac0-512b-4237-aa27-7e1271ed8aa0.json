      "If security decisions are based directly on this information, an attacker can alter the outcome of those decisions.&nbsp; For example, if your thick client sends a list of roles held by the user, the user can alter that list.&nbsp; Role caching cookies are another example of this; unless the cookie is tamper-proofed via signing and encryption, the user can alter their role in the system at will.",
      "Security decisions should never be made based on client input, regardless of the application type, input type, or user group.&nbsp; This includes making security decisions based on things like Request.ServerName, which is under client control, and based on the contents of non-tamper-proofed cookies.&nbsp;",
      "The only exception to this rule is the use of passwords.&nbsp; While a password submitted by a client is technically client input, it is used only to make an authentication check, not to make further security decisions.",
