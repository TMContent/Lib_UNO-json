<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>If you must serialize your class and it contains sensitive data, avoid serializing the fields that contain the sensitive data. Either implement <b>ISerializable</b> to control the serialization behavior or decorate fields that contain sensitive data with the &#91;<b>NonSerialized</b>&#93; attribute. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>This is important because serialization places the data in memory, often in preparation for sending it over a network, making it easier for an attacker to gain access to it.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>You need to be able to marshal object by value across a .NET remoting boundary (that is, across application domains, processes, or computers) or if you want to be able to persist the object state to create a flat data stream, perhaps for storage on the file system.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>By default, all private and public fields are serialized. </p>
  <p>The following example shows how to use the <b>&#91;NonSerialized&#93;</b> attribute to ensure that a specific field which contains sensitive data cannot be serialized.</p>
  <pre>&#91;Serializable&#93;<br />public class Employee &#123;<br />&nbsp; // OK for name to be serialized<br />&nbsp; private string name;<br />&nbsp; // Prevent salary being serialized<br />&nbsp; &#91;NonSerialized&#93; private double annualSalary;<br />&nbsp; . . .<br />&#125;</pre>
  <p>Alternatively, implement the <b>ISerializable</b> interface and explicitly control the serialization process. If you must serialize the sensitive item or items of data, consider encrypting the data first. The code that de-serializes your object must have access to the decryption key.</p>
