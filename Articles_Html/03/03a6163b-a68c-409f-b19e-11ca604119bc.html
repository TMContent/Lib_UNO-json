<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>To make it easier maintain and review your code, place all unmanaged API calls in a wrapper assembly</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>his allows you to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Easily determine the set of unmanaged APIs your application is dependant on. <li>Isolate your unmanaged calls in a single assembly. <li>Isolate the <b>UnmanagedCodePermission </b>to a single assembly.</li></li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Isolate all unmanaged API calls in a wrapper assembly.&nbsp;Use naming conventions to keep native code risks in mind when you develop and review code. Categorize your unmanaged code and use a prefix to indicate the types that you use to encapsulate the unmanaged APIs. </p>
  <p>Use the word <i>Safe </i>to identify code that poses no possible security threat and is harmless for any code, malicious or otherwise, to call. You can annotate safe classes with the <b>SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity</b> attribute, which turns off the code-access security permission's demand for full trust. </p>
  <pre>&#91;SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity&#93;<br />class SafeNativeMethods &#123;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DllImport("user32")&#93;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal static extern void MessageBox(string text);<br />&#125;  </pre>
  <p>Use the word <i>Native</i> to identify unmanaged code that is potentially unsafe but is protected with a full stack-walking demand for the unmanaged code permission. These are implicitly made by the interop layer unless they have been suppressed with the <b>SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity</b> attribute. </p>
  <pre>class NativeMethods &#123;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#91;DllImport("user32")&#93;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal static extern void FormatDrive(string driveLetter);<br />&#125;  </pre>
  <p>Use the word <i>Unsafe</i> to identify unmanaged code that is potentially unsafe and that has the security demand for the unmanaged code permission declaratively suppressed. Any caller of these methods must do a full security review to ensure that the usage is safe because no stack walk is performed. </p>
  <pre>&#91;SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity&#93;<br />class UnsafeNativeMethods &#123;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#91;DllImport("user32")&#93;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal static extern void CreateFile(string fileName);<br />&#125;</pre>
