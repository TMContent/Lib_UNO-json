<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft&#174; Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) 3.5 <li>Microsoft Visual Studio&#174; 2008</li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use IIS to host your WCF service because it provides a large number of features for efficient service management and scalability. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>By using IIS as your WCF service host you can take full advantage of IIS features, such as process recycling, idle shutdown, process health monitoring, and message-based activation. .</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>IIS 6.0 only supports bindings over http so if you need to use TCP, MSMQ or named pipes you should host in a Windows service instead.&nbsp; IIS 7.0 supports all the commonly used transport protocols such as HTTP, TCP, MSMQ, and named pipes.</p>
