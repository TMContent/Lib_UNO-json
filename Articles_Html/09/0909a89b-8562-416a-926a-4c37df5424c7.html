<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.1</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The full card track contents should not be stored under any circumstances.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The full card track contents should not be stored to limit the potential damage in the event of a successful attack. The term "track contents" refers to the information stored on the magnetic strip of the physical card issued to a cardholder. New cards also
 include a chip, the contents of which should be also considered "track contents." If an attacker has this information, he may be able to use it to make fraudulent transactions; therefore, the full track contents should never be stored.
</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the following to make sure that the full track contents are not stored:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incoming transactions </li>
    <li>All logs (transaction, history, debugging, error) </li>
    <li>History files </li>
    <li>Trace files </li>
    <li>Database schemas </li>
    <li>Database contents </li>
    <li>Any other place where cardholder data is stored</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify the storage mechanism that stores the full track contents, for example a script or a database query. Change the storage mechanism so that it does not record the full track contents.</p>
