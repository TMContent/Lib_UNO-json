<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check that all access is denied by default in web server settings and in authorization code.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Denying all access by default assures that only explicitly authorized access is possible.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To make sure all access is denied by default:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate all sensitive pages.</strong> Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive or private information.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that all access is denied by default on the web server.</strong> Examine the web server configuration to make sure that all access is denied by default unless explicitly authorized.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Verify that all access is denied by default in authorization code. </strong>Review your application's authorization code to make sure that all access is denied by default.</p>
