<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 6.6</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>
    <span>Deploy a web application firewall in front of a public-facing web application.</span>
  </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>
    <span>A web application firewall may prevent an attacker from successfully exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing web application. It is not necessary to install a web application firewall to achieve PCI DSS compliance if all public-facing web applications
 are reviewed at least annually.</span>
  </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>
    <span>Use the following steps to deploy a web application firewall in compliance with PCI DSS:</span>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Choose a WAF. </strong>
      <span>Decide whether to conduct regular reviews of the web application or to install a web application firewall. If you decide on a web application firewall, c</span>hoose a web application firewall based on compatibility
 with your log server, availability of vendor support, and considerations listed on the OWASP Web Application Firewall page</li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Deploy the WAF.</strong> Install the web application firewall in front of the public-facing web application. Please refer to the vendor's documentation for detailed instructions on how to install and configure your web application firewall (WAF)
 of choice. Often, the installation process simply means wiring the physical firewall in front of the web application and configuring some basic TCP/IP settings.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Configure the WAF. </strong>The configuration process and available options vary by vendor. Please refer to your vendor's documentation or technical support for detailed instructions on setting up your web application firewall.</li>
  </ol>
