  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Log unusual activity.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unusual activity may be an indication that an attack is in progress.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to implement logging of unusual activity:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define unusual activity.</strong> Make a list of events that constitute unusual activity. Some examples are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Repeated failed authentication attempts <li>Invalid logical access attempts <li>Failed password reset attempts <li>Suspicious financial transactions <li>Unauthorized data access <li>Suspicious database queries that may indicate SQL injection attempts </li></li></li></li></li></li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Identify relevant code.</strong> Use the list of unusual activity indicators to find code that implements the functionality for each unusual activity. Make a list of functions that implement the related functionality. One common area for detecting suspicious activity is authentication code.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Identify the logging subsystem.</strong> The logging subsystem should provide an API that allows generating log entries from application code. If this API or the logging subsystems don't exist, write them. Make a list of functions that may be used to generate log entries and collect documentation about how to use them.</p>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Log unusual activity. </strong>Use the list of functions that are related to suspicious events from step 2 to add code that generates log entries when suspicious activity occurs. Use the list of logging APIs from step 3 to write code that generates log entries.</p>
          </li>
        </li>
