<h2>What to Check For</h2>
<p>Verify that return values of functions are checked for validity.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Some functions will either return a valid value or a value that represents an error condition. Checking the return values of such functions is important to assure that errors are handled. This is particularly important to memory allocation functions.</p>
<h2>How to Check</h2>
<p>Make a list of functions. Identify functions that return error codes. Identify code that uses these functions. Verify that code that uses these functions checks the return values for errors and handles errors appropriately.</p>
<h2>How to Fix</h2>
<p>Make a list of functions. Identify functions that return error codes. If possible, rewrite these functions to throw exceptions instead. Identify code that uses these functions. Add code that handles errors appropriately.</p>
