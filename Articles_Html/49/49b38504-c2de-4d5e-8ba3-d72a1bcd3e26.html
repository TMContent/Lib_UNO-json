<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that the confidentiality of session cookies is protected.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Session cookies are used by an application to identify the session associated with a particular user. Protecting session cookies can help prevent an attacker from hijacking the session and using the application as a legitimate user.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to verify that your application's session cookies are handled securely:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that session identifiers cannot be guessed.</strong> Ensure that your application's session identifiers cannot be guessed by an attacker. Verify that your application's session IDs meet the following requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Length</strong>: Verify that your application uses long session identifiers (e.g. string of length 32).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Triviality</strong>: Verify that your application uses randomly generated session identifiers. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Lifetime</strong>: Verify that your application uses <strong>timeout </strong>attribute to expire sessions. </p>
          <pre>&lt;sessionState timeout="20"<strong></strong>... &gt;   <br />...&lt;/sessionState&gt;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Recycling</strong>: Verify that your application does not reuse previously used sessions.</p>
          <pre>&lt;sessionState regenerateExpiredSessionId="false"<strong></strong>... &gt;   <br />...&lt;/sessionState&gt;</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that users can invalidate their own sessions.</strong> Ensure that your application's uses <strong>Session.Abandon</strong> to allow its users to invalidate their own sessions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that session cookies are sent over encrypted channels.</strong> Ensure your application transmits session cookies over encrypted channels. Although this is not required for non-sensitive transactions, it is mandatory for any transactions that are sensitive in nature.</p>
      <pre>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;  <br />&lt;forms <strong>requireSSL="true" </strong>... /&gt;<br />&lt;/authentication&gt; <br />... <br />&lt;roleManager <strong>cookieRequireSSL="true" ... </strong>&gt;  <br />...<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;</pre>If session cookies cannot be sent over an encrypted channel, ensure that <strong>cookieSlidingExpiration</strong> is set to <strong>false</strong>.<pre>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;  <br />&lt;forms <strong>slidingExpiration="false"</strong> ... /&gt;<br />&lt;/authentication&gt; <br />... <br />&lt;roleManager <strong>cookieSlidingExpiration="false" ... </strong>&gt;  <br />...<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that sensitive cookies are marked httpOnly.</strong> Ensure that cookies are marked as <strong>httpOnly</strong>. <br /></p>
      <pre>&lt;system.web&gt;  <br />...   <br /><strong>&lt;httpCookies httpOnlyCookies="true" ... /&gt; </strong><br />...<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>A web application uses SSL to provide a secure connection for user data, generates strong, new session IDs for each user, and times out and terminates sessions appropriately. However, it is susceptible to cross-site scripting flaws, and despite having a user base which mostly uses IE, does not set <strong>httpOnlyCookies</strong> on its cookies. The web.config file for this application looks like this:</p>
  <pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />...  <br />&lt;httpCookies httpOnlyCookies="<strong>false</strong>" requireSSL="true" topic="" /&gt;<br />...<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;</pre>
