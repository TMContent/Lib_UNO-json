  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>You may need to create an X.509 certificate to aid in development and debugging of your WCF service. Temporary certificates are easier to generate and cost less money than a certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority so they are well suited for a development environment.</p>
  <p>To create a temporary X.509 certificate in development environment use the MakeCert utility. In a production environment use an X.509 certificate issued by a Certificate Authority such as VeriSign.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Do not use temporary development certificates in a production environment as this will open your communication channel to malicious spoofing, sniffing and tampering.</p>
