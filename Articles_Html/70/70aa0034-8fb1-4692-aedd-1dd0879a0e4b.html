<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. With a stateless protocol such as HTTP, use a framework that maintains the state for you. Examples include ASP.NET
<em>View State</em> and the OWASP <em>ESAPI Session Management </em>feature. Be careful of language features that provide state support, since these might be provided as a convenience to the programmer and may not be considering security.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The framework works on a lower level than the application and is therefore better suited to provide session management. Most mature web application frameworks offer secure session management functionality.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To use session management offered by the framework, please refer to the documentation for your chosen framework.
