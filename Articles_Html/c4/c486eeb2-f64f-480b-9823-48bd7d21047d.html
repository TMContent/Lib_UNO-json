<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that inactive sessions time-out.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Make sessions expire after a period of inactivity to make it harder for an attacker to hijack a session.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that inactive sessions time-out:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the time-out period.</strong> Examine project documentation to identify the required time-out period. If the inactive time-out period is configurable, find out the currently defined time-out period from the administrative interface.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Login to the application.</strong> Login to the application as a normal user.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Verify that the session times out after a certain period.</strong> Wait for the duration of the defined time-out period. Verify that the session has timed out.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The reason for such a high-level approach is because there are multiple ways to make inactive sessions time-out and this functionality is enabled by default on many Java platforms. </p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To make inactive sessions time-out:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify login functionality.</strong> Find code that handles user logins.</p>
      <li>
        <p />
        <strong>Add code that sets the inactive session time-out period.</strong>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
