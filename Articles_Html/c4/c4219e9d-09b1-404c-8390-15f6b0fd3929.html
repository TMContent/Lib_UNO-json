  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that only strong TLS algorithms are used.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using strong encryption algorithms with TLS helps reduce the risk of successful eavesdropping attacks and assures regulatory compliance.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that only strong TLS algorithms are used:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the server configuration interface.</strong> TLS is usually configured on the web application server. Please, refer to your web application server's documentation or technical support for more information about configuring TLS on your web server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine the server configuration settings. </strong>Verify that the web application server is configured to use only FIPS 140-2 compliant algorithms. This means no SSLv1 or SSLv3. In practice, this means using TLSv1 or higher. For more information about compliant algorithms, please see the links at the bottom of this page.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To use strong TLS algorithms, configure the web application server to use TLS and not SSL 3.0 or any earlier version of SSL. The exact instructions for doing so are different for different platforms. Please, refer to your web application server's documentation or technical support for detailed instructions on how to configure the server to use TLS.</p>
