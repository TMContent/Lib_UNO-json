In some extremely rare circumstances uninitialized variables might lead to other types of vulnerabilities. In practice, uninitialized variables are not something that attackers look for and are not in themselves exploitable. It is, however, considered good programming practice to always initialize variables before using them.\n</p><h1>Countermeasures</h1><p>To prevent uninitialized variable vulnerabilities, initialize variables before using them.\n</p><ul>\n<li> <a href=\"377919e5-9cd3-40f1-9658-1d4cdabf2b3a\">Initialize All Variables Before Use</a></li>\n</ul><h1>Application Check</h1><p>To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, ensure that variables are initialized before being used.\n</p><ul>\n<li> <a href=\"d284ab1c-86f5-441d-84df-f25bcbb58f3a\">Variables Are Initialized Before Use</a></li>\n</ul><h1>Computer Based Training Links</h1><p>Use the following Computer Based Training courses for more background information about this type of vulnerabilities.\n</p><h2>Creating Secure Code – C/C++ Foundations</h2><p>This course will provide an overview of the threat modeling process and describe the ways to collect information for your application, build the activity-matrix and threat profile, and analyze risks.
