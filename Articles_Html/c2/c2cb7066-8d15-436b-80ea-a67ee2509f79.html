<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 8.2.6</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use unique passwords for new user accounts and make the user change them after first use.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Passwords for new user accounts should be unique and changed after first use to ensure that strong passwords are used and that as few people as possible know the passwords.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that passwords for new user accounts are unique and have to be changed after first use.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Update policy.</strong> Formulate the user authentication policy based on the guideline article linked at the bottom of this page.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Generate unique passwords.</strong> Use a random password generator to generate new unique passwords. The probability of the same strong password being generated twice is so low that it is negligible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure Microsoft Active Directory.</strong> When creating a new account, check the box that says, "User must change password at next logon." If there has been no dialog that has presented such option, this option may be found by following these
 directions: Click on "Start", "Programs", "Administrative Tools", "Active Directory Users and Computers", navigate to the user list, right click on the new user account, select "Properties", select the "Account" tab, the "User must change password at next
 logon" checkbox will be there.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
