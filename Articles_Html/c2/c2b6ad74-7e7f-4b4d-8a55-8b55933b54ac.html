  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that the "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag is set on session cookies.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Set the "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag on session cookies to protect the contents of the session cookies from Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Setting the "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag on session cookies ensures their contents cannot be accessed by user-side scripts.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that the "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag is set on session cookies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Log in to the application.</strong> Open the application and authenticate. Navigate to pages that uses sessions to make sure that a session is created.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that session cookies have the "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag set.</strong> Use the web browser to view stored cookies. Make sure that the application session ID cookie has the "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag set.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Check the <em>php.ini</em> file.</strong> If testing with a browser is not appropriate, check the <em>php.ini</em> file to make sure the "<em>session.cookie_httponly</em>" directive is set to "<em>On</em>".</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To set the "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag on session cookies, edit the <em>php.ini</em> file and configure the "<em>session.cookie_httponly</em>" setting, like this:</p>
  <pre>session.cookie_httponly = On</pre>
