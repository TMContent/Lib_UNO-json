  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that pointers that are passed as arguments to functions are checked for null before dereferencing.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Dereferencing a null pointer causes the program to crash. Validating pointers before using them prevents unexpected crashes.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Search for all functions that accept pointers as arguments. Verify that pointers are checked for null in each function before they are dereferenced.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify all functions that accept pointers as arguments. Add code that checks pointers for null before the rest of the program uses these pointers for data access.</p>
