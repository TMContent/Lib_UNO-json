  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the information security policy that forbids sending unencrypted cardholder data. Make an explicit reference to instant messaging software and PANs.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>

  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the information security policy that forbids employees from sending unencrypted PANs using instant messaging software. Instruct staff members to not use instant messaging software to send unencrypted PANs.</p>
