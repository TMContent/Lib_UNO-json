  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that session IDs are changed during authentication.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Change session IDs during authentication to make sure that the session state corresponds to the authenticated user.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that session IDs are changed during authentication:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify authentication functionality. </strong>Find the code that is responsible for authentication.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that session IDs are changed during authentication.</strong> Review code responsible for logging in to make sure that code exists that clears the existing session state and creates a new session ID. For example:</p>
        <pre>HttpSession session = request.getSession();<br />session.invalidate();<br />session = request.getSession(true);</pre>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To change session IDs during login:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify&amp;nbsp;authentication functionality.</strong> Find the code that is responsible for authentication.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Change session IDs during authentication.</strong> Add code that invalidates the current session ID and creates a new one. For example:</p>
        <pre>HttpSession session = request.getSession();<br />session.invalidate();<br />session = request.getSession(true);</pre>
      </li>
    </li>
