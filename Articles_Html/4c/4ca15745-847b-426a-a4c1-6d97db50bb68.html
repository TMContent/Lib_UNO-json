<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that your application protects roles data in the&nbsp;authorization cookie to stop users from modifying the list of roles to which they belong, and to stop intruders from gaining information about the roles used by your application. </p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Protect the authorization cookie by appropriately configuring the &lt;<b>roleManager</b>&gt; element as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the <b>cookieProtection</b> attribute to <b>All</b>. This ensures that the role names in the cookie are digitally signed and encrypted to prevent unauthorized viewing and modification of the role data. <li>Set the <b>cookieSlidingExpiration</b> attribute to <b>true</b> and the <b>cookieTimeout</b> attribute to an integer number of minutes (for example, 10 to 20 or fewer). The cookie expires when the timeout expires and must be renewed. <li>Set the <b>cookieRequireSSL</b> attribute to <b>true</b> to specify that the authorization cookie with the role information should only be returned to the server over HTTPS connections. <li>Set the <b>createPersistentCookie</b> attribute to <b>false</b> to ensure that the roles cookie is session-based and not a persistent cookie. <li>If you cannot use SSL, consider reducing the <b>cookieTimeout</b> to 10 minutes. If you are concerned with cookie hijacking, consider setting the <b>cookieSlidingExpiration</b> attribute to false. This causes the cookie to expire after the fixed timeout period and must be renewed. </li></li></li></li></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following example shows a &lt;<b>roleManager</b>&gt; element configured to protect the authorization cookie:</p>
  <p>
    <pre>&lt;roleManager enabled="true"<br />             cacheRolesInCookie="true"<br />             cookieName=".ASPROLES"<br />             cookieTimeout="30"<br />             cookiePath="/"<br />             cookieRequireSSL="true"<br />             cookieSlidingExpiration="true"<br />             cookieProtection="All"<br />             createPersistentCookie="false"&gt;<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;</pre>
