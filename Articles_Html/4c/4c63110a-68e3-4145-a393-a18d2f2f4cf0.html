<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 10.7</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Require logs to be kept for at least a year. Keep at least three months of logs available for immediate review.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the information security policy that requires all logs in the PCI DSS scope to be kept for at least a year. Configure the centralized log server to keep the logs for at least a year and to keep at least the latest three months of logs available
 for immediate review. The exact instructions for configuring a log server vary by solution. Please refer to vendor's documentation or contact technical support for more information about configuring your log server to retain the logs for at least a year. Most
 log servers will be able to make a year's worth of logs available for immediate review, thus satisfying both aspects of the PCI DSS log retention requirement.
