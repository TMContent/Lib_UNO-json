  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Manage service providers&nbsp;that handle shared&nbsp;cardholder data.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Service providers&nbsp;that handle&nbsp;shared&nbsp;cardholder data have to share responsibility for the security of that data.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If the company shares cardholder data with service providers for purposes such as back-ups or analysis, take the following actions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>List providers. </strong>Make a list of all service providers who share cardholder data. Attach the list to the information security documentation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Make sure service providers acknowledge responsibility for security. </strong>
Have each service provider&nbsp;who shares&nbsp;cardholder data sign a form, which&nbsp;states that&nbsp;the provider takes responsibility for securing cardholder data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Perform due diligence. </strong>Perform due diligence before engaging any service provider. Document the due diligence process and attach this information to the information security documentation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Monitor PCI DSS compliance of service providers. </strong>Check the PCI DSS compliance status of each service provider and attach this information to the information security policy.&nbsp;Delegate responsibility for monitoring PCI DSS compliance of service
 providers to a qualified staff member. </p>
    </li>
