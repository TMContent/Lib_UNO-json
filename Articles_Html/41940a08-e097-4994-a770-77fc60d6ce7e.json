      "Content spoofing vulnerabilities occur when the application can be manipulated to display malicious content injected by the attacker. This is a very broad vulnerability class that can have multiple causes. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can result in content spoofing, and cross-site scripting is itself a broad vulnerability class. Content spoofing can also result from poor authentication controls that allow the attacker to substitute application data with malicious data.",
