<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Mask all password fields - use input controls that hide user input for password fields by covering user input with a &quot;mask&quot;, typically a character, such as &quot;*&quot;. When a user enters a password &quot;password&quot;, the masked field may look like &quot;********&quot;.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Masking password fields helps protect user passwords from someone that may be looking at their screen.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>To mask all password fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify all password-type fields in the application.</strong> Review all the pages in the application to find all password-type fields. Password-type fields include secret answers, CVV, PIN, and other data, which is equivalent to passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use password fields that mask user input.</strong> Use whatever mechanism is practical to mask the entered passwords. For web applications, this can be done by using the <code>password</code> input type, like so:</p>
<pre><code> &lt;form&gt;
 ...
 &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;pass&quot; AUTOCOMPLETE=&quot;off&quot;/&gt;
 ...
 &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
