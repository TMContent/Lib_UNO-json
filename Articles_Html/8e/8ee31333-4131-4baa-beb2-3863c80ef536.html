<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that a&nbsp;custom trust policy file&nbsp;is created if your application requires additional permissions beyond those provided at a particular trust level, and it does not need the additional permissions provided by the next trust level.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>To avoid granting your application unnecessary permissions.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To create a custom policy, copy the trust level policy file that most closely matches your application's permission requirements to create a new custom policy file. Locate this file in the standard policy file directory, which is &#37;Windir&#37;\Microsoft.NET\Framework\&#123;Version&#125;\CONFIG. Then add the required additional permissions to the custom policy file and configure your application to run using the custom policy. </p>
