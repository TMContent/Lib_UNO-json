<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Instrument your application for all user management events, including authentication successes and failures, password resets or changes, account lockouts, etc. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Doing this helps you to detect and react to potentially suspicious behavior.&nbsp; It also enables you to gather operations data; for example, to track who is accessing your application and when user account passwords need to be reset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All systems with authentication components should log when those components are used, both successfully and unsuccessfully. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>By default, ASP.NET health monitoring records all <b>WebFailureAuditEvents</b>, which ASP.NET raises when user authentication fails in forms authentication with the membership system.&nbsp; ASP.NET also raises a <b>WebFailureAuditEvent</b> when authorization is not granted to a resource protected by file authorization and URL authorization. </p>
