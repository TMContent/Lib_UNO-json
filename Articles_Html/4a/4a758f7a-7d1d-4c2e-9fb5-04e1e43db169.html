  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>All the manufacturer's default usernames and passwords should be changed.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The default usernames and passwords are publicly available information. An attacker may be able to use the default authentication credentials to gain unauthorized access. This vulnerability is especially
 relevant to potential insider attacks.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>For each system component, including servers, workstations, network devices, applications, security systems, etc. obtain the default administrator username and password by using the Internet or the vendor's documentation. Try to log in to each device using the default administrator credentials.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>If it is possible to log in to a system component using the default administrator credentials, then change the password&nbsp;and change the username of the administrator account, if possible. The exact procedure for changing the administrator username and/or password
 varies. For detailed instructions on changing the username and password, please refer to the vendor's documentation or contact technical support.</p>
