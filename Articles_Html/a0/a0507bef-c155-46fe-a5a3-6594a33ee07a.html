  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use a "deny-all" default setting for all access control systems.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Access control systems should have a "deny-all" default to ensure that all access is explicitly authorized.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following tasks to enable the "deny-all" default setting on access control systems:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable the "deny-all" ACL default setting on UNIX-type systems.</strong> Add the "umask 077" command to the login scripts for all users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable the "deny-all" ACL default setting on Windows systems.</strong> Delete any excessive permissions by using the controls in the “Security” tab: right click on each drive, select "Properties", go to the "Security" tab, and delete all access permissions
 that are not explicitly authorized.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable the "deny-all" ACL default settings on other system-types.</strong> Most operating systems implement either the UNIX or the Windows type ACL system. Some network devices may have to be configured using a web interface. Follow vendor's instructions
 to configure ACL defaults on such devices.</p>
    </li>
