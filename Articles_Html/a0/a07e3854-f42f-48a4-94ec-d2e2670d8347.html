    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 4.1.1</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Configure wireless networks to use strong encryption to protect authentication and network traffic.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Strong encryption and authentication protocols for wireless communications prevent both unauthorized access to the network and eavesdropping on wireless communications. An earlier implementation of wireless encryption and authentication, known as WEP, has
 proven to be insecure.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Configure the wireless access point(s) to use strong encryption and authentication protocols, such as WPA or WPA2. The detailed instructions for enabling strong encryption and authentication vary by wireless access points and network designs. Please refer
 to the vendor's documentation or technical support for specific instructions on enabling strong encryption and authentication protocols on your wireless network(s).</p>
