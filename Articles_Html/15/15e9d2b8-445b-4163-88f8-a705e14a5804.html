<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <p>Scala and Play Framework 2.1.0+<br /></p>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Mask all password fields. Use input controls that hide user input for password fields by covering user input with a "mask", typically a character, such as "*". When a user enters a password "<em>password</em>", the masked field may look like "<em>********</em>".</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Masking password fields helps protect user passwords from someone that may be looking at the screen.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To mask all password fields:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all password fields in the application.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Review all the pages in the application to find all password fields.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use password fields that mask user input.</strong>&amp;nbsp;There are different approaches to masking user input:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Masking password fields is usually done by using a "<em>password</em>" type HTML input field, as follows:</p>
          <pre>&lt;form&gt;<br />&lt;input type="password" name="pass" autocomplete="off" /&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt; </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set the "<em>autocomplete</em>" attribute to "<em>off</em>" to prevent the user's browser from caching the entered password.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you are using third party controls for password fields, choose ones that mask user input.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you are implementing custom controls for password fields, implement these controls in such a way that they mask user input.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
