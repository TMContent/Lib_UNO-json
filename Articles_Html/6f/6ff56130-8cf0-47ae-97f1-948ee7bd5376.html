<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>If SSL cannot be used to protect authorization cookies for an application, set <b>cookieSlidingExpiration</b> to <b>false</b> and set cookie timeouts to limit the lifetime of authorization cookies. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>There are a few cases where SSL is not possible; one such scenario might be mobile devices which lack SSL support.&nbsp; In these cases expiring authentication cookies reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker intent on stealing the cookie to falsly authenticate. This is not a replacement for SSL, however, and offers much less security.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>An application which can not use SSL to protect authorization cookies should use these techniques to offer a minimal level of protection. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you cannot use SSL, the following steps will help mitigate the risk to your application.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Limit the cookie lifetime to reduce the time window in which an attacker can use a captured cookie to gain access to your application with a spoofed identity.&nbsp; The default timeout for an authentication cookie is 30 minutes.&nbsp; Consider reducing this to 10 minutes as shown here:</p>
      <pre>&lt;roleManager ...<br />             cookieTimeout="10"<br />             ...&gt;<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;</pre>
      <li>
        <p>The default setting of <b>cookieSlidingExpiration="true"</b> ensures that the cookie expiration period is reset after each Web request.&nbsp; If the user interaction model will allow you or if you are in a scenario where you are concerned about cookie hijacking, consider setting <b>cookieSlidingExpiration="false"</b>.&nbsp; If you do so, the authorization cookie expires after the timeout period whether or not the user is active and&nbsp;the user must re-authorize/re-authenticate.&nbsp; The following code will turn off <strong>cookieSlidingExpiration</strong>: </p>
        <pre>&lt;roleManager&nbsp;...<br />             cookieSlidingExpiration="true"<br />             ...&gt;<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;</pre>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>A web site normally used by mobile customers without SSL uses the default settings for authorization cookie management.&nbsp; A user temporarily uses a public terminal to connect to the site, checks their account status briefly, and then browses other (unsecured) parts of the site.&nbsp; Because they're still refreshing the site, when an attacker sits down at their machine ten minutes after they get up, the attacker is&nbsp;able to go directly to the site and alter the user's settings without needing to log in again.</p>

  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>A web site normally used by mobile customers without SSL locks down their settings for authorization cookie management.&nbsp; A user temporarily uses a public terminal to connect to the site, checks their account status briefly, and then browses other (unsecured) parts of the site.&nbsp; As soon as ten minutes have elapsed since their login, their authorization cookies expire, but this doesn't affect them browsing.&nbsp; When an attacker sits down at their machine ten minutes after the user&nbsp;gets up, the attacker is locked out of the site.</p>
