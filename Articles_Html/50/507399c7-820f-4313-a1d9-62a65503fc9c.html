<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Be aware that impersonation prevents the efficient use of connection pooling if you access downstream databases by using the impersonated identity. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>This impacts the ability of your application to scale. Also, using impersonation can introduce other security vulnerabilities, particularly in multi-threaded applications, such as ASP.NET Web applications. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>You might need impersonation if you need to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flow the original caller's security context to the middle tier and/or data tier of your Web application to support fine-grained (per-user) authorization. <li>Flow the original caller's security context to the downstream tiers to support operating system level auditing. <li>Access a particular network resource by using a specific identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li></li>
  </ul>
