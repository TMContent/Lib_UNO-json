  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Enable TLS for all the sensitive pages on the web application server. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>TLS should be used to protect all pages that handle sensitive data to protect from Man-in-the-Middle attacks.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>The exact instructions for enabling TLS are different for different servers. Enabling TLS is a common task and is well documented for common web server platforms. Links at the bottom of this page lead to documentation that explains how to enable TLS on different platforms. There are some general guidelines that apply to different platforms:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Get valid certificates.</strong> Purchase a valid TLS certificate. You may purchase a valid TLS key from VeriSign, Thawte, or your web hosting provider. Follow the vendor's instructions for purchasing the TLS certificate. The certificate is usually a .cer file. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive pages. </strong>Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive information, including all pages that use authentication or authorization features.</p>
