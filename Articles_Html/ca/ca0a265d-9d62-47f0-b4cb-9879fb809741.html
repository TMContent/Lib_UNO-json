  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Log files should be removed from production servers on a regular basis.&amp;nbsp; The frequency of removal is dependent upon your application's level of activity.&amp;nbsp; Your design should consider the way that log files will be retrieved and moved to offline servers for analysis.&amp;nbsp; Any additional protocols and ports opened on the Web server for this purpose must be securely locked down.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>There's no point in logging activity if the log files are never analyzed. </p>
  <span>
  </span>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Log files should be archived regularly to ensure that they do not fill up or start to cycle, and they should be regularly analyzed to detect signs of intrusion.</p>
