<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft&#174; Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) 3.5 <li>Microsoft Visual Studio&#174; 2008</li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Protect sensitive data when it is transmitted over the network. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>This allows you to protect your clients from being spoofed when adding a service reference. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Consider using this guideline when items of sensitive data, such as credentials and application-specific data, are transmitted over a network link.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Using a safe protocol to transmit information is important because it adds protection against inadvertent eavesdropping and modification during transport. If you need to send sensitive data between the client and WCF service, consider using message or transport security. If you need to protect server-to-server communication, such as between your WCF service and a Microsoft SQL Server&#174; database, consider Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) or SSL.</p>
