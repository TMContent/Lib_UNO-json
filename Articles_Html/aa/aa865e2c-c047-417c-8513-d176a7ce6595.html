<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Heed the warnings of compilers and linkers, since they may alert you to improper usage.
</p>
  <p>Examine compiler warnings closely and eliminate problems with potential security implications, such as signed / unsigned mismatch in memory operations, or the use of uninitialized variables. Even if the weakness is rarely exploitable, a single failure may
 lead to the compromise of the entire system.</p>
