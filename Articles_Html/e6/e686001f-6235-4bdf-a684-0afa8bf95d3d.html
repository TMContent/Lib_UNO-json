  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <pre>public static void GenerateAndStoreSymmetricAESKey()<br /> &amp;#123;<br />    // The .NET framework supports several symmetric or block ciphers including: Rijndael (AES),<br />     // DES, 3DES, RC2, etc.<br />     // Symmetric (secret key) encryption algorithms assume that both parties know the secret<br />     // key and initialization vector or IV (when using a chained mode for the crypto<br />    // operation). Protecting the secret key by both recipients is vital to the protection<br />    // of data transmitted or stored by both parties.<br />    // Symmetric ciphers are often well suited to protecting large blocks of data between two<br />    // or more parties when the secret key has been negotiated in a secure manner.<br />    // There exist many block ciphers today, however perhaps the most popular is AES, the<br />    // current encryption standard approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology<br />    // (NIST). The AES algorithm was created by two Belgian cryptographers and commonly<br />     // referred to as Rijndael as is the case in the .NET framework.<br />    // The following call will create a Rijndael (AES) Crypto Provider with a cryptographically<br />    // random key and initialization vector.

Typically this method need not be called unless<br />     // it is desired to "re-key".  Re-keying may be performed in some communication protocols<br />    // to mitigate the likelihood of an adversary having compromised a secret key used<br />    // to protect the session.<br />    // By default in the .NET framework a call to Rijndael.Create() constructor will<br />    // automatically generate a key and associated it with the object created (stored in the<br />     // Key member).<br />    rij.GenerateKey();<br />    // Encryption keys should be protected in storage.

  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code sample demonstrates hardcoded the encryption key and initialization vector which is a common pitfall by many developers.</p>
  <pre>Rijndael rijndaelAlg = Rijndael.Create();<br />//Set secret key for the AES algorithm.<br />rijndaelAlg.Key = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes("_A_SAMPLE_KEY_WE_USE_TO_ENCRYPT_");<br />// Hardcode our IVrijndaelAlg.IV = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes("SAMPLEIV");</pre>
  <ul>
    <li>If an unauthorized user gains access to the application source code or compiled code he/she will be able to extract the key and decrypt all future communications. <li>A hardcoded initialization vector does not provide full confidentiality of messages in that all equivalent plaintext messages will result in the same encrypted value, providing knowledge to an attacker about common messages.</li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Test Case</h1>
  <p>The following classes must be included in any project making use of the sample code provided above:</p>
  <pre>using System.Security;<br />using System.Security.AccessControl;<br />using System.Security.Cryptography;<br />using Microsoft.Win32;</pre>
  <p>Execute the following code and then open "regedit" and look in the registry under the key "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\AESSymmetricKey" to see the AES shared secret key encrypted in the registry via the DPAPI.</p>
  <pre>static void Main(string&amp;#91;&amp;#93; args)&amp;#123;<br />  // Generate an AES encryption key and store in the registry<br />  // using DPAPI  GenerateAndStoreSymmetricAESKey();<br />&amp;#125;</pre>
  <h1>Expected Result</h1>
  <p>The AES key is encrypted using DPAPI and stored in the registry key, "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\AESSymmetricKey"</p>
  <h1>Scenarios</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>The application is required to store sensitive data in an encrypted form <li>Two entities in a client-server or client-client architecture need to transmit data in an encrypted form <li>Application developers should not have access to production encryption keys; a product support group may use a utility containing the solution code to set the production encryption keys.</li></li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>More Information</h1>
  <p>Symmetric (secret key) encryption algorithms assume that both parties know the secret key and initialization vector or IV (when using a chained mode for the crypto operation an Initialization Vector is required). Protecting the secret key by both recipients is vital to the protection of data transmitted or stored by both parties. Symmetric ciphers are often well suited to protecting large blocks of data between two or more parties when the secret key has been negotiated in a secure manner. There exist many block ciphers today, however perhaps the most popular is AES, the current encryption standard approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The AES algorithm was created by two Belgian cryptographers and commonly referred to as 'Rijndael', as is the case in the .NET framework.</p>
  <p>While encryption keys should be protected in storage, the IV need not be protected, as an intermediary who intercepts an encrypted communications still needs the secret key to decrypt the message. However, the recipient of the encrypted data needs the IV to successfully decrypt the message.&amp;nbsp; It is common for an encrypted text (ciphertext) to be preceeded by the IV used in the chaining of the encryption routine. Because the IV is a fixed length (as determined by the encryption cipher), the recipient of the encrypted text must remove the IV from the beginning of the message and use this value in conjunction with the shared secret key to decrypt the message.</p>
