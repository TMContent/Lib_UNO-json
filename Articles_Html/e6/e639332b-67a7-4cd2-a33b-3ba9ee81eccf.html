<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Project documentation should include the results of a security code review.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A properly conducted code review can do more for the security of your code than nearly any other activity. A code review allows you to find and fix a large number of security issues before the code is tested or shipped. In addition, the code review process allows the development team to share security best practices and experience, which can prevent future security issues.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Examine project documentation to verify that it includes the results of a security code review. These results should include a set of identified vulnerabilities ready to be prioritized for repair.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform a security code review by following these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify security code review objectives.</strong> Establish goals and constraints for the review. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Perform a preliminary scan.</strong> Use static analysis to find an initial set of security issues and to improve your understanding of where you will be most likely to find security issues when you review the code more fully. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review the code for security issues.</strong> Review the code thoroughly with the goal of finding security vulnerabilities that are common to many applications. You can use the results of step 2 to focus your analysis. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review for security issues unique to the architecture.</strong> Complete a final analysis by looking for security issues that relate to the unique architecture of your application. This step is most important if you have implemented a custom security mechanism or any feature designed specifically to mitigate a known security threat.</p>
