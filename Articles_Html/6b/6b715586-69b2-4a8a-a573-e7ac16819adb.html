<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Encrypt and sign the data transported over the channel and to authenticate callers. for this, you can configure the &lt;<b>channel</b>&gt; element and set <strong>authenticationMode</strong> as "<strong>IndentifyCallers</strong>" and <strong>secure</strong> as "<strong>true</strong>",&nbsp;in the Machine.config file, the Web.config file, or the App.config file, depending on whether you want to apply the setting across all applications on your computer or to a specific application.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>When data is sent over a wire, it typically passes through several intermediate relays on it's way towards&nbsp;some final destination. Using a&nbsp;encryption and authentication&nbsp;to transmit information is important because it adds protection against inadvertent eavesdropping and modification in mid transport.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This guideline should be followed when implementing an application to use TCP channel with remoting.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>The following example shows how a server specifies that authentication is required and that the channel should be protected with encryption.</p>
  <pre>&lt;channel ref="tcp" port="1234"<br />          authenticationMode="IdentifyCallers" secure="true" /&gt;  </pre>
  <p>To authenticate clients by using their domain credentials, you need to set the <b>useDefaultCredentials</b> attribute of the &lt;<b>channel</b>&gt; in the client configuration to true. The following example shows a sample client configuration.</p>
  <pre>&lt;channel ref="tcp" useDefaultCredentials="true" secure="true"<br />          impersonationLevel="Identify" /&gt;  </pre>
  <p>To use Kerberos authentication, the client must specify a service principal name (SPN). This can be done programmatically or in the client's configuration file, as shown in the following example.</p>
  <pre>&lt;channel ref="tcp"<br />          useDefaultCredentials="true"<br />          impersonationLevel="Identify"<br />          spn="someService/somehost.com" /&gt;  </pre>
