  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Running WCF Service with a specific identity helps to isolate your service, allows you to restrict service resources to your application's account, allows you to use Windows auditing to track the activity of the application separately from other applications or services.</p>
  <p>If your service is hosted in IIS 6.0, use IIS Manager to create an application pool running as a specific identity. Use IIS Manager to assign your WCF Service to that application pool.</p>
  <p>If your service is hosted in Windows Service, configure the Windows Service to run using the particular identity, the WCF service will run under the security context of the Windows Service.</p>
