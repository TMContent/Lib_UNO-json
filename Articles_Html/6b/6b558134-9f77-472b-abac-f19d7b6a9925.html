<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>If a web application uses TLS, the server should support the latest version.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Old versions of SSL contain known vulnerabilities. The latest TLS version has addressed these vulnerabilities. New vulnerabilities may be found in the future, requiring a newer version of TLS to be used.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Examine the server configuration to make sure that the latest version of TLS is used and only strong cypher suites are enabled.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Configure the server to use the latest version of TLS with strong cypher suites.</p>
