  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>If a web application uses TLS, the server should support the latest patched version.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Old versions of SSL and TLS have known vulnerabilities in them, which makes them unacceptable. The latest version of TLS has addressed these vulnerabilities. New vulnerabilities may be found in the future, requiring a newer version of TLS to be used.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use one of the free online SSL/TLS testing tools to scan your site to determine if old versions of TLS or weak cypher suites are being used.<br /></p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Configure your application's web server to use the latest version of TLS.<br /></p>
