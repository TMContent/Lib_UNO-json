<h1>Description</h1><p>HTTP Response Splitting occurs when an attacker is able to inject arbitrary data into the headers of HTTP responses. This vulnerability allows the attacker to force HTTP responses that contain HTML of the attacker's choosing. HTTP Response Splitting applies to web applications that place user input in HTTP response headers. 
</p><h1>Impact</h1><p>HTTP response splitting gives the attacker full control over the HTTP response. The attacker can use this control to conduct phishing and cross-site scripting attacks. The attacker may create a fake login page and make it appear to be a part of your application by using HTTP response splitting. That fake login page can be used by the attacker to collect the passwords of the users. The attacker may also inject arbitrary JavaScript into pages that are served by the application using HTTP response splitting. These scripts may redirect the application's users to a malicious site, steal their session cookies, or record users' keystrokes. Either through phishing or through cross-site scripting, the attacker may leverage HTTP response splitting to take over an administrator's account and gain full control of the application.
</p><h1>Countermeasures</h1><p>To prevent this vulnerability, validate all input and URL-encode data in HTTP response headers. 
</p><p>
Validate all input:</p><ul>
<li> <a href="3de41277-0cc1-4ebc-8dd7-e96d161aa0ef">Validate All Input</a></li>
<li> <a href="e59923e7-c2fb-4a75-8db7-a9a91e869f74">Validate Input for Length, Range, Format, And Type</a></li>
</ul><p>
URL-encode data in HTTP response headers:</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001bb278">URL-encode Data in HTTP Response Headers</a></li>
</ul><h1>Application Check</h1><p>To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, ensure that all input is validated, and ensure that all data in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded. 
</p><p>
All input is validated:</p><ul>
<li> <a href="a210fcb7-f142-4c2e-844a-c43e0859f90d">All Input Is Validated</a></li>
<li> <a href="0e71dd64-87d1-4cf5-9569-ea320f209977">Input Is Validated for Length, Range, Format, And Type</a></li>
</ul><p>
Data in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded:</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003c0cd2">Data in HTTP Response Headers Is URL-encoded</a></li>
