      "The architecture and design review process analyzes the architecture and design from a security perspective. If you have just completed the design, the design documentation can help you with this process. Regardless of how comprehensive your design documentation is, you must be able to decompose your application and be able to identify key items, including trust boundaries, data flow, entry points, and privileged code. You must also know the physical deployment configuration of your application. Pay attention to the design approaches you have adopted for those areas that most commonly exhibit vulnerabilities. This guide refers to these as application vulnerability categories.",

  "html": "<h1>Summary </h1>\n  <p>The architecture and design review process analyzes the architecture and design from a security perspective. If you have just completed the design, the design documentation can help you with this process. Regardless of how comprehensive your design documentation is, you must be able to decompose your application and be able to identify key items, including trust boundaries, data flow, entry points, and privileged code. You must also know the physical deployment configuration of your application. Pay attention to the design approaches you have adopted for those areas that most commonly exhibit vulnerabilities. This guide refers to these as application vulnerability categories.</p>\n  <h1>Summary of Steps</h1>\n  <p>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa302421.f05thcm01&#37;28en-us,MSDN.10&#37;29.gif\" border=\"0\" />\n  </p>\n  <p>Use the following steps to perform a security design review:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Analyze the deployment and infrastructure.</strong> You review the design of your application in relation to the target deployment environment and the associated security policies.
