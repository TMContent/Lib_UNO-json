  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that URLScan is installed and configured so that all HTTP requests are filtered.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>URLScan is installed when you run IISLockdown, although you can download it and install it separately.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IIS 6.0 on Windows Server 2003 has functionality equivalent to URLScan built in. Your decision whether to install UrlScan should be based on your specific organizational requirements. For more information, see "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx#eeaa">Installing UrlScan 2.5</a>."</blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>To install URLScan without running IISLockdown</b>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download IISlockd.exe from <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/iis50/utility/2.1/nt45xp/en-us/iislockd.exe">http://download.microsoft.com/download/iis50/Utility/2.1/NT45XP/EN-US/iislockd.exe</a>. 
</li>
    <li>Run the following command to extract the URLScan setup: 
<p>i<b>islockd.exe /q /c</b></p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>URLScan blocks requests that contain unsafe characters (for example, characters that have been used to exploit vulnerabilities, such as ".." used for directory traversal). URLScan logs requests that contain these characters in the %windir%\system32\inetsrv\urlscan directory.</p>
  <p>You configure URLScan using settings in the .ini file %windir%\system32\inetsrv\urlscan\urlscan.ini.</p>
  <p>In addition to blocking malicious requests, you can use URLScan to defend your server against denial of service attacks before the requests reach ASP.NET. To do this, set limits in the <b>MaxAllowedContentLength</b>, <b>MaxUrl</b>, and <b>MaxQueryString</b> arguments in the URLScan.ini file. For more information, see "<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302368.aspx">How To: Use&nbsp;URLScan</a>" in the "How To" section of this guide.</p>
  <h3>Reversing URLScan Changes</h3>
  <p>There is no automatic operation to remove URLScan. If you have problems with URLScan, you can either remove it from IIS or you can analyze the problem by logging requests that are rejected. To do this, use the option <b>RejectResponseUrl=/~*</b> in the URLScan .ini file.</p>
