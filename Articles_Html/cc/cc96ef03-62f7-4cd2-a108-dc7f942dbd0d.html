<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>If you are using digital certificates, you can use the X.509 certificate support in the <b>System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates</b> namespace to encrypt XML data. </p>
  <p>To use X.509 certificates, access the certificate from the certificate store, create a new instance of the <b>EncryptedXml</b> class, call its <b>Encrypt</b> method, and pass the certificate. Finally, replace the clear text XML element with the <b>EncrytedData</b> element. </p>
  <p>To be able to decrypt the data, you must have the private key associated with the public key in the X.509 certificate. </p>
