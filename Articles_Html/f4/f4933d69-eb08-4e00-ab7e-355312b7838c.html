<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 7.2.2</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use access control systems to enforce access privileges, which should be defined based on job functions.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Access control privileges should reflect job requirements in order to allow the employees to do the work but prevent them from waging insider attacks.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Identify the job functions of each employee. Identify the data access required for each employee. Define the data access privileges for each employee based on job responsibilities. Have the management review and authorize the data access privilege specifications.
 Once approved, implement the data access control systems. Attach the access authorization documents to the network documentation.</p>
