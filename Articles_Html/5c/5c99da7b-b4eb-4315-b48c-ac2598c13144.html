  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>During a double encoding attack, the attacker encodes attack data twice using hex representation of a character (using methods known as percent encoding or URL encoding) so that the attack is not detected by security filters. This vulnerability is often used during SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and path traversal attacks in order to submit malicious data through request parameters. A vulnerable application decodes the attack data twice before it executes the malicious command. </p>
  <p>Follow these steps to test for double encoding bugs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1: Understand attack scenarios </li>
    <li>Step 2: Analyze causes and countermeasures </li>
    <li>Step 3: Start testing and exploring </li>
    <li>Step 4: Execute additional testing<br /></li>
  </ul>
  <p />
  <h1>Step 1: Understand attack scenarios</h1>
  <p>The first step in testing for double encoding vulnerabilities is to understand the common attack scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Path traversal </li>
    <li>Cross-site scripting (XSS) </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    <em>Scenario 1: Path Traversal</em>
  </h2>
  <p>During a path traversal attack, an attacker needs to traverse a directory in order to find a secret document:</p>
  <pre>http://victim/documents/getDocs.jsp?docname=../../secret.pdf </pre>
  <p />
  <p>However, the page <i>getDocs.jsp</i> filters out the filename provided in the URL and denies any sequence of two dots followed by a slash: <em>../</em> . To get around this, the attacker replaces the dots and slashes with their URL-encoded equivalent (<em>%2e</em> and <em>%2f</em>, respectively):</p>
  <pre>%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fprivate/secret.pdf</pre>
  <p>However, the application also recognizes the sequence <i>%2e%2e%2f</i> as a path traversal construct, and denies the attack string. So the attacker executes a double encoding attack by re-encoding the percent (<em>%</em>) character with its URL-encoded equivalent (<em>%25</em>):</p>
  <pre>%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fprivate/secret.pdf</pre>
  <p>A vulnerable application decodes the malicious string twice, translating it to a path traversal string to complete the attack.</p>
  <h2>
    <em>Scenario 2: Cross-site Scripting</em>
  </h2>
  <p>During a cross-site scripting attack, an attacker needs to submit special characters like pointed brackets, slashes, and backslashes. The attacker might first try to execute a string like this:</p>
  <pre>&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
  <p>If the above string doesn’t work, the attacker might try to URL encode special characters one time:</p>
  <pre>%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C%2Fscript%3E</pre>
  <p>However, the application disallows this string because it contains dangerous URL-encoded characters such as <i>%3C and %3E.</i> Next, the attacker tries double encoding the attack string:</p>
  <pre>%253Cscript%253Ealert('XSS')%253C%252Fscript%253E</pre>
  <p>Note that the new construct doesn’t contain singly encoded dangerous hex characters like <em>%3C</em>. The application recognizes the string as safe, and, because it is vulnerable to double encoding, it double decodes the string, translating it to the original XSS construct.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>Step 2: Analyze causes and countermeasures</h1>
  <p>The next step in testing for double encoding bugs is to understand what causes them and how to protect against them.</p>
  <p>Some applications protect against malicious input by filtering out dangerous characters. Any incoming string is checked against a list, known as a <i>blacklist</i>, of dangerous constructs<i>. </i>If the input contains a blacklisted construct like “../”, the application doesn’t allow the operation. For instance, the following code implements a blacklist check in <i>exsistsInBlacklist:</i></p>
  <pre>if (existsInBlacklist(request.getParameter("filename") == false))
{
String filename = new String();
URLDecoder decoder = new URLDecoder();
filename = decoder.decode(request.getParameter("filename").toString(), "UTF-8");

File file = new File(filename);
/* continue opening file */
}</pre>
  <p>To protect against path traversal, an application needs to include double-encoded character sequences such as <em>%252e%252e%252f</em> in its blacklist. Failing to do so would lead to a double encoding vulnerability. A better option would be implementing the check for a malicious construct on the canonical form. However, blacklists are not recommended because they must account for 100% of dangerous constructs; any dangerous construct not covered in the blacklist allows attacks on the application.</p>
  <p>Therefore, to protect against this vulnerability, use a <i>whitelist</i> approach. Whitelists allow only valid constructs; any construct not in the whitelist is automatically disallowed. This way, developers need only define what is good, and don’t have to worry about covering 100% of all dangerous constructs. For instance, the code below enforces a whitelist that uses a regular expression to check for safe input filenames. The regular expression allows only filenames of five to eight upper- or lower-case letters followed by the <em>.pdf</em> string. Any string that doesn’t match this form, like the path traversal string <em>../</em> , causes the application to produce an error message:</p>
  <pre>String filename = new String();
URLDecoder decoder = new URLDecoder();
filename = decoder.decode(request.getParameter("filename").toString(), "UTF-8");

String safeConstruct = "^[a-zA-Z]{5,8}.pdf$";
Pattern regexPattern =  Pattern.compile(safeConstruct);
Matcher regexMatcher = regexPattern.matcher(filename);

if (!regexMatcher.find())
{
out.println("invalid input");
}
else
{
File file = new File(filename);
/* continue opening file */
...
}</pre>
  <p>Note that the code uses the whitelist approach on the canonical form of the input. It first decodes the input  and then calls the regular expression on the decoded input.</p>
  <h1>Step 3: Start Testing and Exploring</h1>
  <p>Now that you’ve looked at double encoding attack scenarios and understand what causes them and how to protect against them, it is necessary to include double encoding issues when testing for different security issues.  </p>

  <h1>Step 4: Execute Additional Testing</h1>
  <p>The final step in testing for double encoding vulnerabilities is to make sure to look for them when executing any attacks that use hex character encoding. Additional attacks may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>XML injection </li>
    <li>LDAP injection </li>
    <li>Command injection </li>
    <li>HTTP response splitting </li>
    <li>URL parameter tampering </li>
    <li>XPath injection</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>Attackers commonly use double encoding bugs to bypass security filters when attacking the application through HTTP request parameters. To test for double encoding bugs, you must understand the attack scenarios as well as what causes them and how to defend against them. Apply this knowledge when testing for request parameter bugs such as XSS, SQL injection, and path traversal. Finally, include double encoding test cases for any security vulnerability payloads tested via HTTP request parameters.</p>
