  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Define policies for the acceptable use of technology.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to define the acceptable use policy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for management approval. </strong>Add a point that requires explicit management authorization to use the technologies.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for authentication. </strong>Add a point that requires users to be authenticated with a password or some other security mechanism to use the technologies.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for an&amp;nbsp;authorized devices&amp;nbsp;list. </strong>Add a point that requires a list of all devices and the staff authorized to use them.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for labeling. </strong>Add a point that requires devices to be labeled with owner, contact information and purpose.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for acceptable use. </strong>Add a point that requires acceptable uses for the technology. This requirement seems redundant, but it is actually explicit in demanding that technology be used only in its intended purpose.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for network locations. </strong>Add a point that requires acceptable network locations for the technology. Acceptable network locations are the networks secured in compliance with PCI DSS. For example, a computer from the cardholder
 data environment may not be connected to the Internet directly. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for a list of approved products. </strong>Add a point that requires a list of company-approved products. Make a list of company-approved products and add it to the information security documentation.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for remote-access time-out. </strong>Add a point that requires idle remote sessions to be disconnected automatically after no more than 15 minutes.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a requirement for managing vendor remote-access. </strong>Add a point that requires remote access accounts for vendors to be enabled only when needed and disabled immediately thereafter.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add a prohibition of remote-access downloads of sensitive data. </strong>
Add a point that forbids downloading cardholder data to local storage media over a remote access connection.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
