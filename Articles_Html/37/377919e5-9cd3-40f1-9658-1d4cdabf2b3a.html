<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>When declaring a new variable in your function, initialize the variable to a value before it is used.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unitialized variables may have garbage values in them that can cause your program to run unpredictably. Worse yet, variables which default initialize to 0 in a debugger may default to a garbage value in production causing your application to behave differently in a production environment than it does on your development machine.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>When declaring new variables in&nbsp;a function.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>When declaring a new variable make sure it is initialized to a safe value before it is used. If its first use is to assign a value from some other operation, that is ok. If its first use is to be read for the purpose of a calculation, array index or other operation, make sure the initialization has occurred first.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>In the following code the array is indexed with an uninitialized variable.</p>
  <pre>char&#42; ArrayIndexing()<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; int index;<br />  char &#42;buffer = stringArray&#91;index&#93;;  <br />  return buffer;<br />&#125;</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In the following code the array is indexed with an initialized variable.</p>
  <pre>char&#42; ArrayIndexing()<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; int index = 0;<br />  char &#42;buffer = stringArray&#91;index&#93;;  <br />  return buffer;<br />&#125;</pre>
