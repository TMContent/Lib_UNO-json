<p>Once an application has been created, it should be run through an extensive system hardening process to reduce the attack surface. This should include cleaning up unused code or modules and removing any accounts or features used in the creation process. During the development process, features used for testing or quality assurance may be forgotten and included in the shipped product. By reducing the amount of extraneous code or forgotten features, you can ensure that potential backdoors and exploits are not included in a production environment. View this room to learn to best practices for hardening a server both before and after deployment.

</ul><h2>Protect Connection Strings</h2><p>Connection strings include the location of the backend database, associated credentials and all other information that assists in establishing the connection between the application and its backend database server. Compromising the connection strings can aid an attacker in accessing the database server on behalf of the application.

</ul><h2>Reduce Application Fingerprints</h2><p>Uniquely identifiable strings, such as application name and version number, are telltale signs that the application is running on your system. These telltale signs, or fingerprints, are often searched for via automated scripts that look for a target to attack.

</ul><h2>Remove Test Accounts</h2><p>Test accounts provide access to the application's functionality during development. Since they are often poorly secured, they are a common target for attackers.
