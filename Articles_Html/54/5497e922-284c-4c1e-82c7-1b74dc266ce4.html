<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 8.5.8</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Shared or group accounts should not be used. Each user should have an individual account.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Not using shared accounts ensures that actions can be traced back to individual users; this is known as non-repudiation.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to make sure that shared accounts are not used:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Make a list of authorized users.</strong> Review the authorization forms in the network documentation and make a list of authorized users.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Make&amp;nbsp;a list of user accounts.</strong> Use the user management application to review user accounts. Make a list of accounts. In a Microsoft Active Directory environment, the user management application can be launched by clicking on "Start", "Programs",
 "Administrative Tools", "Active Directory Users and Computers".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Examine the list of user accounts. </strong>The number of user accounts should not be less than the number of authorized users. Make sure that there are no shared accounts on the list. A shared account is an account that is used by more than one
 person.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following tasks to assure that shared accounts are not used:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Delete shared accounts. </strong>Launch the the user management application by clicking on "Start", "Programs", "Administrative Tools", "Active Directory Users and Computers". Delete all shared accounts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create new user accounts.</strong> Make a new unique account for each authorized person that has been using the shared account. To create a new user, navigate to the user list, right click on it, select "New", "User"</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure the new user accounts.</strong> Fill in the user account information in the "New Object - User" dialog. Configure group membership and data access control permissions for the new user account. Peform other actions associated with creating
 new user accounts, such as adding e-mail accounts, allocating personal work-space, etc.</p>
    </li>
