  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Limit access to encryption keys to as few people as possible.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The fewer people with access to the encryption keys, the less likely it is that the encryption keys are disclosed ("leak out") or that an insider attack is conducted successfully.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Identify the people with access to the encryption keys. Identify the access control mechanism that limits access to the encryption keys. If there is no access control mechanism, implement one. Take away the access permissions from the people who do not need
 access to the encryption keys. Change the encryption keys if it was necessary to rescind access from anyone.</p>
