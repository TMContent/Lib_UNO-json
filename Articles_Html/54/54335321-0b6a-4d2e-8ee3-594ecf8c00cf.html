</ul><h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that object references that are passed as parameters to functions are checked for null before being used.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Check function parameters for null before using them to prevent your application from crashing if it tries to use that parameter as an object.
</p><h2>How to Check</h2><p>To verify that object references that are passed as parameters to functions are checked for null before being used:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify all functions that accept object references as parameters.</strong> Make a spreadsheet of all functions that accept object references as parameters. Most functions in your application will probably be in that spreadsheet and that is okay.</li>
<li> <strong>Verify that object references that are passed as parameters are validated.</strong> Examine each function that accepts object references as parameters. Verify that each object reference is checked for null before being used as an object. If a function is passed null as a parameter instead of an object, the function should either throw an exception or simply not use that parameter as an object.</li>

</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify all functions that accept object references as parameters.</strong> Make a spreadsheet of all functions that accept object references as parameters. Most functions in your application will probably be in that spreadsheet and that is okay.</li>
<li> <strong>Update all functions that accept object references as parameters to check parameters for null.</strong> At the beginning of each function that accepts object references, add code to check each reference for null. If a function is passed null as a parameter instead of an object, the function should either throw an exception or simply not use that parameter as an object.</li>
