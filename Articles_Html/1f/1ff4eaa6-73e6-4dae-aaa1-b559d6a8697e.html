<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Some symbol should be used to "mask" all the digits of the PAN except for the last four on any page where the PAN is displayed and the viewer does not have a legitimate business need to see the entire PAN.
</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>PANs are very sensitive and displaying them on the screen or on print-outs is unacceptable.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Make a list of all the pages where a PAN is displayed. View every source and the corresponding output page to make sure that the PAN is masked.
</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Implement masking in the function(s) used to print the PAN by substituting some character for all the digits in the PAN except the last four.
