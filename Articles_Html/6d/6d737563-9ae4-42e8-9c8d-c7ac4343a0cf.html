<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Consider where items of sensitive data, such as credentials and application-specific data, are transmitted over a network link. Use a protocol that boasts adequate/strong encryption to protect said data. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The internet is full of abstractions and layers. When data is sent over a wire, it typically passes through several intermediate relays on it's way towards&nbsp;some final destination. Using a safe protocol to transmit information is important because it adds protection against inadvertent eavesdropping and modification in mid transport. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This is appropriate whenever sensitive data needs to be sent between two hosts, whether it is using the public internet or a private LAN as a transmission medium. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you need to send sensitive data between the Web server and browser, consider using SSL. If you need to protect server-to-server communication, such as between your Web server and database, consider IPSec or SSL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
