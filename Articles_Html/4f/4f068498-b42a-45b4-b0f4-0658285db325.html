  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>If you need to support clients in an Intranet, consider using Transport Security.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>This provides point to point security and better performance when compared to Message Security.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Consider using this guideline when you want to support clients in an Intranet.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use transport security when your clients are deployed within an intranet, as it provides point to point security and better performance compared to Message Security.</p>
  <p>In an intranet you have control over the communication between client and service, and very few chances of having any intermediaries which might break the transport security. You can use netTCPbinding for better performance than HTTP bindings.&nbsp; netTcpbinding by default uses binary encoding and transport security.</p>
