<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.1</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Formulate the data retention and disposal policies to be included in the information security policy. Implementing the policies is often a matter of following them rather than a technological solution.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The information security policy should provide guidelines for the retention and disposal of the cardholder data to ensure that the cardholder data is handled in a secure matter.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to prepare the data retention and disposal policies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Formulate the data retention policy. </strong>The data retention policy should describe the legal, regulatory, and business requirements. The exact requirements are specific to your business. Identify the requirements and write them down in the form
 of, "Cardholder Data X should be retained for time period Y for legal/regulatory/business reason Z." Add the data retention requirements to the information security policy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Formulate the data disposal policy. </strong>The data disposal policy should describe the secure deletion mechanism and the process for periodic removal of old cardholder data. Choose a secure deletion application. An example of secure deletion software
 is "Eraser." Add a point to the data disposal policy that describes the use of chosen secure deletion software, mentioning that software makes erased data unrecoverable. Write a description of the process to periodically remove the cardholder data that has
 exceeded retention requirements. Decide whether to use an automated solution or to designate a person responsible for periodically removing the old cardholder data. Document the chosen solution and include the documentation in the data disposal policy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the stored cardholder data. </strong>Design your applications and business operations to store the cardholder data securely. If your applications are already deployed, make sure they are implemented in accordance with the PCI DSS requirements.
 Design and implement your applications and business processes so that the full card track contents are never stored. Design and implement your applications and business processes so that the card verification value is never stored. Design and implement your
 applications and business processes so that the PIN is never stored. Design and implement your applications and business processes so that the PAN is masked whenever it is displayed. Design and implement your applications and business processes so that the
 PAN is always encrypted when stored. If using full-disk encryption, choose a disk encryption suite that has its own authentication mechanism, separate from the OS or the network. Windows BitLocker may be acceptable in the USB Key Mode. One acceptable full-disk
 encryption suite is TrueCrypt. Protect the data-encrypting keys with a master key. Designate two or three people as key custodians and give each one a fraction of the master key so that together they may reassemble the master key when needed. Have the key
 custodians sign a form to acknowledge their responsibilities and include the signed forms in the network documentation.</p>
