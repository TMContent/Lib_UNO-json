<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that all forms that require authentication or can be used to trigger important functionality are protected with ViewStateUserKey.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A one-click attack consists of posting a malicious HTTP form to a known, vulnerable Web site. It is called "one-click" because it usually begins with an unaware victim clicking on an alluring link received through e-mail or found when navigating a crowded forum.&nbsp; By following the link, the user inadvertently triggers a remote process that ends up submitting the malicious form to a site.&nbsp; This allows an attacker to perform any action caused by the vulnerable form with the credentials of the victim.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>ViewStateUserKey</strong> makes it much harder for hackers to use the content of the client-side view state to prepare malicious posts against the site.&nbsp; Each time a form is invoked, a unique key is generated.&nbsp; The key contains encrypted time and session information, and the form submission is rejected if it is used in another session or after the session timeout has expired. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check whether ViewStateUserKey is used properly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify pages that should be protected. </strong>Review your application and make a list of all the forms that should be protected with ViewStateUserKey.&nbsp; Forms that meet either of the following criteria should be protected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The form requires authentication </li>
        <li>The form triggers important application behavior or a write operation to a persistent store (eg. SQL database)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check to see if the pages are protected. </strong>ViewStateUserKey can be set per page or in the <strong>OnInit</strong> virtual method of the page-derived class.&nbsp; </p>
      <ol>
        <li>First check <strong>OnInit</strong>, if you find protection there, then all of your pages are covered.<br /><br /><pre>protected override OnInit(EventArgs e) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; base.OnInit(e); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre></li>
        <li>Next check the individual pages, for instance:<br /><br /><pre>void Page_Init (object sender, EventArgs e) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure ViewStateUserKey is set properly. </strong>Setting <strong>ViewStateUserKey</strong> to a constant string—the same for all users—is like leaving it blank.&nbsp; It must be set to something that varies for each user—such as user ID or, better yet, session ID.&nbsp; For a number of technical and social reasons, session ID is a much better fit because a session ID is unpredictable, times out, and varies on a per-user basis. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>The&nbsp;following code added to each&nbsp;of your pages will set the key based on SessionID.</p>
  <pre>void Page_Init (object sender, EventArgs e) {<br />   ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre>
  <p>Alternatively, you can add this code to the <b>OnInit</b> virtual method of the <b>Page</b>-derived class.&nbsp; (Note that you must set this property in the <b>Page.Init</b> event).&nbsp; This will allow you to write the code once rather than per page.</p>
  <pre>protected override OnInit(EventArgs e) {<br />   base.OnInit(e); <br />   ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre>
  <ul>
  </ul>
