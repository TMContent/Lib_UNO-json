<h2>What to Check For</h2>
<p>Verify that authentication controls are implemented on the server-side.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Server-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.</p>
<h2>How to Check</h2>
<p>To verify that server-side authentication is used:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify authentication controls.</strong> Find code that is responsible for authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Verify that authentication controls are implemented on the server.</strong> Review authentication code to make sure that authentication is performed on the server.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Fix</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define authentication requirements.</strong> Consider the following aspects of authentication control as they pertain to your application:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Enforcing password strength requirements.</li>
<li>Allowing secure password reset or recovery.</li>
<li>Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.</li>
<li>Using multi-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.</li>
<li>Using TLS to secure communications.</li>
<li>Throttling repeated authentication attempts.</li>
<li>Locking inactive authentication accounts.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Implement authentication on the server.</strong> It is important to implement security controls such as authentication on the server, because an attacker can tamper with client-side security controls or disable them altogether. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end.</li>
<li><strong>Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.</strong> Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An interface for managing authentication credentials.</li>
<li>Network code that communicates with the server using TLS.</li>
<li>A token or some other means to maintain session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.</li>
</ul>
