  <p>If you are using client certificate authentication, consider&amp;nbsp;limiting the certificates in the certificate store.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you are using certificate authentication, consider reducing the attack surface by limiting the certificates in the certificates store. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider deleting all the root certificates from the trusted root certification authorities store not required to authenticate your clients. <li>If your client base is large, consider using chain trust validation instead of peer trust so you have a smaller number of certificates to manage.<li>If your client base is small, consider using to peer trust validation authentication.&amp;nbsp; This will require that you manage one certificate per user basis. Any users not installed in the trusted people store will be denied access to the service.</li></li></li>
