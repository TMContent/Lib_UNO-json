<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use SSL to protect session cookies on authenticated pages. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Failing to protect authentication tickets is a common vulnerability that can lead to unauthorized spoofing and impersonation, session hijacking, and elevation of privilege.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All systems which use cookies for authentication should protect those cookies via SSL on all pages which require authentication, and ensure that the cookies are not used/sent for pages which do not require authentication and do not use SSL. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Set <b>requireSSL="true"</b> on the &lt;<b>forms</b>&gt; element, as shown in the following code.</p>
  <p>
    <pre>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<br />       requireSSL="true" ... /&gt;  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>By setting <b>requireSSL="true"</b>, you set the <b>secure</b> cookie property that determines whether browsers should send the cookie back to the server. With the <b>secure</b> property set, the cookie is sent by the browser only to a secure page that is requested using an HTTPS URL. </p>
