<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure your application automatically locks inactive user accounts. Verify that all instances of locking inactive accounts are logged. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Inactive user accounts increase the attack surface of the application and can be used by an attacker as a means of entry.</p>
  <h1>How To Check</h1>
  <p>Take the following steps during the design phase to make sure your application has the capability to lock inactive user accounts.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify your application stores the user's last login date or inactivity information. </strong>Check if your application has the necessary procedures to store and retrieve last-login and lock-out information about its users. Common locations for storing such information include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Database that stores user account information. Verify that the last login date for each user is stored and updated every time a user authentication succeeds. Also check that a column exists to store the lock/unlock status information for each user. </li>
        <li>Data structures that represent user accounts. Verify that fields exist to store the last login date and lock/unlock status. </li>
        <li>Routines that handle user login. Verify that the last-login timestamp is reset to the current timestamp upon a successful authentication attempt. </li>
        <li>Routines that retrieve and update user account information. Verify that a routine exists to update the last login date and inactivity information for the user.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify your application has a lockout policy. </strong>An account lockout policy is typically application specific. Review your application's requirements and design specifications. Check for the following functionality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A mechanism for determining user inactivity </li>
        <li>A mechanism for locking inactive accounts </li>
        <li>A mechanism for unlocking disabled accounts</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify the lockout policy is enforced by default. </strong>Make sure that the functionality that enforces the lockout policy is enabled by default during deployment. Ensure that only users with administrative privileges can amend your application's lockout policy. Verify that all instances of modifying the lockout policy are logged. If your application uses a backend database as its user store, a scheduled database transaction may be used to lock inactive user accounts.
    </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How To Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps when locking inactive user accounts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set a lockout policy. </strong>Create the application's lockout policy. Determine the necessary duration of inactivity before an account can be locked/disabled. This policy can vary depending on whether the account is of a normal user or an administrator. For example, disable normal accounts after 45 days of inactivity and administrative accounts after 30 days of inactivity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Keep track of user inactivity.</strong> Establish a mechanism to keep track of the last successful authentication. Successful authentication can be tracked via logs or a timestamp, which resides in the user database. Example: </p>
      <pre>sql&gt; select username, last_login_date from users</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set a lockout mechanism.</strong> Establish a mechanism to verify the current period of inactivity and automatically set the disabled bit for inactive accounts. Using the application or database server's scheduler, activate such functionality to run during the hours with least user activity. Keep in mind that inactive accounts should be disabled, but not removed until it is confirmed that they should be completely removed. If your application uses a backend database as its user store, consider using a scheduled database transaction to lock inactive user accounts. For example, the following database transaction would lock all user accounts that have been inactive for more than 30 days. Such transaction should be scheduled to run once a day:</p>
      <pre>sql&gt; update users set locked = 1 where (current_date - 30) &gt; last_login_date</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
