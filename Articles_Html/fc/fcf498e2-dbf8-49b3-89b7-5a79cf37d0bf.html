  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Inbound and outbound network traffic should be limited to that which is necessary for business operations. Traffic that is not explicitly allowed should be denied by default.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Denying unauthorized transmissions makes it more difficult for a potential attacker to successfully conduct an attack and extract sensitive information.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the firewall configuration to make sure that there are rules to allow only connections necessary for business purposes. Check the firewall configuration to make sure that incoming and outgoing traffic is denied by default.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify network services necessary for business purposes. Implement a firewall configuration that reflects the ports and protocols used by the required network services. Add an explicit "deny all" statement to the firewall configuration or use an implicit
 "deny after allow" setting.</p>
