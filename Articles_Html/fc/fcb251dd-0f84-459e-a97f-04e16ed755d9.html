<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 10.2.2</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Log all actions taken by users with root or administrator privileges. It might be prudent to log all actions taken by any users with elevated privileges.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>All actions taken by an administrator or another privileged user should be logged to assist with investigations in the event of a compromise or some other situation.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Logging administrator actions on Windows is difficult, because the Windows interface is mostly graphical. There is no built-in functionality in Windows that allows recording Administrator activity to the extent required by PCI DSS. The functionality for
 satisfying Requirement 10.2.2 should be implemented by your centralized log server solution. Please refer to the vendor's documentation or technical support for more information about the capabilities of the product. Install and configure your Administrator
 logging solution of choice by following the vendor's directions.</p>
