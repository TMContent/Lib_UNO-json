  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Cover all system components using access controls.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using access control systems to secure all system components ensures that there is no information that can be retrieved by unauthorized personnel.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Identify all computers and other system components. Examine each system component to make sure it implements an access control system. Most modern Operating Systems and network devices implement access control. If a system component does not implement access
 control, it cannot be used within PCI DSS scope. Set a "deny-all" default on all access control systems. Examine the access authorization documents in the network documentation. Implement the access privileges defined in the access authorization documents.
 The access authorization documents only allow data access that is required for each employee's job function, so they comply with the "least-privilege" principle.</p>
