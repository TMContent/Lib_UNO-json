<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 8.2.4</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Passwords should be changed at least every 90 days.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Changing passwords regularly ensures that if a password has been compromised, it will soon become useless.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if controls are in place to force users to change passwords regularly in an Active Directory environment:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this
 page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the Group Policy Object Editor.</strong>&nbsp;Navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that the "Maximum password age" policy is used.</strong> For each relevant domain, check that there is a linked group policy object that enables the "Maximum password age" policy. The "Maximum password age" policy is enabled by default on
 Windows 2003 and 2008 to require passwords to be changed every 42 days. Verify that it is enabled and set to no more than 90 days. The "Maximum password age" policy is located under "Windows Settings", "Security Settings", "Account Policies", "Password Policy",
 â€œMaximum password age".</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that passwords are changed regularly in an Active Directory environment:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this
 page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Edit or create a Group Policy Object (GPO).</strong> To create and activate a new Group Policy Object (GPO), launch "The Group Policy Management" console, right click on the domain and select "Create and Link a GPO Here." To edit an existing GPO,
 navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit" - this will open the "Group Policy Object Editor." To change the settings of a GPO using the "Group Policy Object Editor, navigate the folders
 to find the setting of interest, double click on it, set the desired option(s).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable&nbsp;the "Maximum password age" policy.</strong>&nbsp;The "Maximum password age" policy is located under "Windows Settings", "Security Settings", "Account Policies", "Password Policy". Set the "Maximum password age" policy to 90 days or less.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
