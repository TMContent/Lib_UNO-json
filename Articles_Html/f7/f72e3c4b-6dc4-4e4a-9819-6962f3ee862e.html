<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.1</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that the network documentation and the Information Security policy include a requirement for a formal process for testing changes to the firewall configuration. Verify that the network documentation includes directions for a procedure to test changes
 to the firewall configuration.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Changes to the firewall configuration must be tested to make sure that vulnerabilities are not introduced inadvertently by the changes made to the firewall configuration.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Examine the network documentation and the Information Security policy to make sure they include a requirement and a description of a process to test changes to the firewall configuration.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the&amp;nbsp;Information Security policy to require following a specific process to test changes to the firewall configuration whenever changes to the firewall configuration are being made.&amp;nbsp;Describe a process for testing changes to the firewall configuration
 in the network documentation.&amp;nbsp;Perform a test run of the testing process to make sure that the process is adequate for your network. For help with implementing a process to test changes to the firewall configuration, please refer to the guideline article "Test
 Changes to the Firewall Configuration," linked below.</p>
