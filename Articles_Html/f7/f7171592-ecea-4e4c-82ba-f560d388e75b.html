<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 6.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Live PANs and other production data should not be used for testing or development. If PANs are used, they should be sanitized before use.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>There may be vulnerabilities in the testing and development environments that may cause unauthorized disclosure. The access controls in the testing and development environments are often not as strict as in the production environment, so using live PANs
 may lead to unauthorized disclosure. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Interview the responsible staff members to make sure they don't use live PANs or other production data for testing or development.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the information security policy to not use live PANs or other production data for testing or development. Instruct the responsible staff members to not use live PANs or other production data for testing or development.</p>
