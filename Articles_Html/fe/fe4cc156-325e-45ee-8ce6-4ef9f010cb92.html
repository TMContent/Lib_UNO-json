  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Protect physical storage media in the cardholder data environment.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Information storage media, which contains cardholder data, should be physically secured to ensure that a thief cannot steal it. This applies to paper hard copies as well as to digital media.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Different companies opt for different security measures. Generally speaking, physical security involves security guards, surveillance operators, surveillance equipment, physical barriers, alarms, locks, and card-based access controls. If your company has
 lax physical security, consider adding layers of the above-mentioned security measures until physical security is considered satisfactory.</p>
