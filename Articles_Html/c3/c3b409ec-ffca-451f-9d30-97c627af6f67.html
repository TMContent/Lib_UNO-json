<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.4.1.c</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Encrypt cardholder data, which is stored on removable media.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Encrypt the cardholder data on removable media to make sure that if the media falls into the possession of an attacker, the cardholder data will still be secure.
</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Identify the types of removable storage media that are used to store cardholder data. Identify encryption applications that are compatible with each type of removable storage media. Install and configure the corresponding encryption application for securing
 the cardholder data on all removable media. Add a point to the information security policy that requires encrypting all cardholder data stored on removable media.</p>
