  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The PAN should be rendered unreadable whenever it is stored.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The PAN should be rendered unreadable whenever it is stored to prevent disclosure in the event of a successful compromise.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Identify if and where the PAN is stored. Examine a sample of database tables or files to verify that PAN is not stored in plain-text. Examine a sample of removable media that contains PAN information, if any, to confirm that the PAN is rendered unreadable.
 Examine a sample of the system logs to verify that the PAN is rendered unreadable or removed from the logs. Identify the mechanism used to secure the PAN. The acceptable mechanisms are: one-way crypto-hashes, truncation, index tokens and pads, and strong cryptography.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify if and where the PAN is stored. Choose one of the following mechanisms to protect the PAN: one-way crypto-hashes, truncation, index tokens and pads, and strong cryptography. Implement the chosen mechanism.</p>
