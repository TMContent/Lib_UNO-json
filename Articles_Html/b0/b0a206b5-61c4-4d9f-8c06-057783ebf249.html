<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Enumerate the different types of users and create specific roles for them. When authorizing access to a resource, build the security checks on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.</p>
<p>Application roles allow administrators to group users into categories that need the same level of privileges. The mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.</p>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>The following segment illustrates an application's access control policy. Because the application does not enforce role-based security, it has a policy entry for each separate user; therefore managing the users' access rights can be quite difficult when the number of users to the application grows.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;authorization&gt;
  &lt;allow users=&quot;NTDomain\joe, NTDomain\sarah, NTDomain\bill, NTDomain\sue&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;deny users=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/authorization&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>The following segment illustrates an application's access control policy. Because the application enforces role-based security, it provides a policy entry for each group of users; therefore increasing the application's users store has no impact on the ability to manage the users' access rights as only the group permissions need to be modified.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;authorization&gt;
  &lt;allow roles=&quot;NTDomain\Employees&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;deny users=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/authorization&gt;
</code></pre>
