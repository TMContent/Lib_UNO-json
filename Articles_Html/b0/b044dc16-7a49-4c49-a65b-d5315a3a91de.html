  <p>The username/password combination supplied by the client will be mapped by the WCF service to a Windows user account.&nbsp; If the user is successfully authorized, the system will next check to see if the user belongs to the group declared with the PrinciplePermission role.&nbsp; Method access will be granted if the user belongs to the role.</p>
