<h2>What to Do</h2><p>Require authentication for all users.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Require authentication for all users to prevent unauthorized access. If a user account is not protected with at least a password, an attacker will be able to easily use that account.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>To force authentication for all users:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify authentication code.</strong> Make a spreadsheet about the code that implements authentication in the application.</li>
<li> <strong>Require authentication for all users.</strong> If it doesn't already require authentication for all users, modify authentication code so that at least a password is required for successful authentication for all users. Remove code that implements any special hard-coded user accounts that don't require authentication.</li>
</ol>
