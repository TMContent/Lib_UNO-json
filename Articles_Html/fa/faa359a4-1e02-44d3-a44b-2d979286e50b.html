<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use a symbol, such as "*", to mask all the digits of the PAN except for the last four on any page where the PAN is displayed and the viewer does not have a legitimate business need to see the entire PAN.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>PANs are very sensitive and displaying them on the screen or on print-outs is unacceptable.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Implement masking in the function(s) used to print the PAN by substituting some character for all the digits in the PAN except the last four.
