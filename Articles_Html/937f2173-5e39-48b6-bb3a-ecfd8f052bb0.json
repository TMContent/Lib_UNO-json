In that case, an attacker can modify the output web page to include malicious script, which is then executed by the browser that views the vulnerable page. XSS applies to all web applications. To prevent XSS, validate all input and encode input included in output. To check for this flaw, find all code that includes user input in output, and verify that user input is sufficiently validated and properly encoded.",

Non-Persistent XSS uses some reflective aspect of the page to deliver the payload.",

The attacker may use this to perform actions on the user's behalf within the application, such as change the password, submit messages, or perform some other actions available to the authenticated user. The malicious script may spread itself, becoming an XSS worm. An XSS worm may use up a lot of resources and be very costly to clean up. The attacker may write a script that steals session cookies or session identifiers and allows impersonating the user. Impersonating the user through stolen cookies is simpler and more powerful than through a script because it allows the attacker to interact with the application visually. The attacker may also use XSS to inject a JavaScript that captures the user's keystrokes on that web site to steal passwords and other information. XSS usually leads to privilege escalation, which the attacker leverages to take over some user's account.
