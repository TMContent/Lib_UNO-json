<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure all public interfaces used solely for testing the application are removed.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Test interfaces add extra functionality that is not intended for the released application. Often these interfaces will be used by a test team to gain information or drive functionality that would be dangerous in the hands of an attacker.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Verify that all test interfaces have been removed by doing the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all test APIs</strong>: Enumerate all public APIs. Identify which APIs are intended for application use and which APIs are intended for test purposes. Use documentation and specifications to help.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that all testing code is removed from the code base</strong>: Locate the implementation for the identified test code. Ensure that it has been isolated from the application.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Ensure that the application was compiled with the release flag</strong>: Open the project for the application with Visual Studio. From the <strong>Build</strong> Menu select <strong>Configuration Manager</strong>. Check that the <strong>active solution configuration</strong> is set to <strong>Release</strong>.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Care should be taken when managing different versions of builds to ensure that only release builds are used in production, as it is difficult (although possible) to determine whether a build was configured as release or debug after the fact.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code shows the user management system for an application. Because the class contains test APIs, it is possible for a malicious user to execute untested code and possibly exploit any vulnerabilities in it.</p>
  <p />
  <pre>public sealed class UserManager<br />&#123;<br />      public UserManager()<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      public boolean AddUser(User user, char&#91;&#93; pass, char&#91;&#93; verifyPass)<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      public boolean RemoveUser(User user)<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      public boolean ModifyUser(User user)<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      public boolean ChangePass(User user, char&#91;&#93; oldPass, char&#91;&#93; pass, char&#91;&#93; verifyPass)<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      // The class contains test APIs<br />      public void AddTestUsers()<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />&#125;</pre>
