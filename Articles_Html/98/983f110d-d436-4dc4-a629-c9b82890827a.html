<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Limit access to functions that use hard-coded credentials. If the software must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials.
 For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.</p>
