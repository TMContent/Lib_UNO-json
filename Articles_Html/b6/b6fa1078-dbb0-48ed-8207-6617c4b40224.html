<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>When deploying an ASP.NET application, if your application runs on the Microsoft Windows Server&nbsp;operating system, make sure that the application pool that you use is running under a limited account with restricted access to the file system and registry. To use a restricted custom account, you must apply the permissions that the account requires by running the Aspnet_regiis.exe utility with the <b>-ga</b> switch. Afterward, configure your application to run in a dedicated application pool that runs under the identity of the custom account.</p>
