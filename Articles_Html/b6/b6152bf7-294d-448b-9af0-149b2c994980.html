  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that unallocated memory is not accessed.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Accessing memory that has been deallocated may result in an exploitable vulnerability. This type of vulnerability is called a "dangling pointer vulnerability". The unallocated memory is accessed via a pointer that has been used to free the memory earlier - this pointer is the "dangling pointer".</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Identify all code that unallocates memory. Verify that pointers are never used after the objects they reference have been deleted.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Code has to be rewritten in a way that does not access unallocated memory. </p>
