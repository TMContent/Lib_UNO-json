  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Access control systems should cover all system components.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using access control systems to secure all system components ensures that there is no information that can be retrieved by unauthorized personnel.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Identify all computers and other system components. Examine each system component to make sure it implements an access control system and that the access control systems are properly configured with a “deny-all” default setting.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify all computers and other system components.&amp;nbsp;Examine each system component to make sure it implements an access control system. Most modern Operating Systems and network devices implement access control. If a system component does not implement access
 control, it cannot be used within the PCI DSS scope. Set a "deny-all" default on all access control systems.&amp;nbsp;Examine the access authorization documents in the network documentation. Implement the access privileges defined in the access authorization documents.
 The access authorization documents should only allow data access that is required for each employee's job function, so they comply with the "least-privilege" principle.</p>
