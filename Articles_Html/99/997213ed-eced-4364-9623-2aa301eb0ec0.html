<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Protect back-end connections. For front-end to back-end connections: Three solutions are possible, although none are complete.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Change passwords periodically.</strong> Use generated passwords or keys that are changed automatically and must be entered at given time intervals by a system administrator. These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Limit access to the back-end.</strong> The passwords or keys should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Time-stamp messages.</strong> The messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay-style attacks.</p>
    </li>
