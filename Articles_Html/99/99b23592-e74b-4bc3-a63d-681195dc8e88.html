<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.</p>
  <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request. </li>
    <li>The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
</li>
    <li>During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.
</li>
    <li>A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
</li>
    <li>Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which
 states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are three main kinds of XSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent).</strong> The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable
 web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs
 constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the
 victim's browser.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Stored XSS (or Persistent).</strong> The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in
 dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or
 interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example,
 the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>DOM-Based XSS.</strong> In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of a script into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves a server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the
 client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.<br />
Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker
 could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim
 into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."<br />
In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks
 less suspicious.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the most prevalent, obstinate, and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications. It's pretty much inevitable when you combine the stateless nature of HTTP, the mixture of data and script in HTML, lots of data passing
 between web sites, diverse encoding schemes, and feature-rich web browsers. If you're not careful, attackers can inject Javascript or other browser-executable content into a web page that your application generates. Your web page is then accessed by other
 users, whose browsers execute that malicious script as if it came from you (because, after all, it *did* come from you). Suddenly, your web site is serving code that you didn't write. The attacker can use a variety of techniques to get the input directly into
 your server, or use an unwitting victim as the middle man in a technical version of the "why do you keep hitting yourself?" game.</p>
  <h2>Detection</h2>
  <p>The ways to check for Cross-Site Scripting are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Automated Static Analysis.</strong> Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy
 and coverage are not feasible, especially when multiple components are involved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Black Box. </strong>Use the XSS Cheat Sheet [R.79.6] or automated test-generation tools to help launch a wide variety of attacks against your web application. The Cheat Sheet contains many subtle XSS variations that are specifically targeted against
 weak XSS defenses. With Stored XSS, the indirection caused by the data store can make it more difficult to find the problem. The tester must first inject the XSS string into the data store, then find the appropriate application functionality in which the XSS
 string is sent to other users of the application. These are two distinct steps in which the activation of the XSS can take place minutes, hours, or days after the XSS was originally injected into the data store.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Mitigation</h2>
  <p>To fix or prevent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use a secure framework.</strong> Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Examples of libraries and frameworks that make it easier to generate properly
 encoded output include Microsoft's <em>Anti-XSS library</em>, the OWASP <em>ESAPI Encoding</em> module, and Apache
<em>Wicket</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Encode data.</strong> Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple
 encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.<br />
For any data that will be output to another web page, especially any data that was received from external inputs, use the appropriate encoding on all non-alphanumeric characters. Parts of the same output document may require different encodings, which will
 vary depending on whether the output is in the: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML body </li>
        <li>Element attributes (such as src="XYZ") </li>
        <li>URIs </li>
        <li>JavaScript sections </li>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets and style property </li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Note:</strong> HTML Entity Encoding is only appropriate for the HTML body. Consult the XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet linked to at the bottom of this article for more details on the types of encoding and escaping that are needed.
</li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate all input.</strong> Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers,
 URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls. This technique has limited effectiveness, but can be helpful when it
 is possible to store client state and sensitive information on the server side instead of in cookies, headers, hidden form fields, etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use server-side security checks.</strong> For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying
 values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Separate data and code. </strong>If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead
 of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use specific character encodings.</strong> For every web page that is generated, use and specify a character encoding such as ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, the web browser may choose a different encoding by guessing which
 encoding is actually being used by the web page. This can cause the web browser to treat certain sequences as special, opening up the client to subtle XSS attacks. See CWE-116 for more mitigations related to encoding/escaping.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>(Java Struts only) Use the bean's filter attribute. </strong>With <em>
Struts</em>, you should write all data from form beans with the bean's <em>filter</em> attribute set to
<em>true</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set the HttpOnly flag on cookies. </strong>To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be
<em>HttpOnly</em>. In browsers that support the <em>HttpOnly</em> feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie.
 This is not a complete solution, since <em>HttpOnly</em> is not supported by all browsers. More importantly,
<em>XMLHTTPRequest</em> and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the
<em>Set-Cookie</em> header in which the <em>HttpOnly</em> flag is set.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Assume all input is malicious.</strong> Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or
 transform it into something that does. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that
 they should be rejected outright. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and
 conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if you are expecting colors such as "red" or "blue."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use white-list input validation.</strong> When dynamically constructing web pages, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not
 just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected
 to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer.
 Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended. Ensure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application. This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use reference maps.</strong> When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>(Optional) Use a web application firewall.</strong> Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency
 prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth. An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection
 mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may
 be required for customization.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>(PHP only) Do not use register_globals.</strong> If you are using PHP, configure your application so that it does not use
<em>register_globals</em>. During implementation, develop your application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a<em> register_globals</em> emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.</p>
