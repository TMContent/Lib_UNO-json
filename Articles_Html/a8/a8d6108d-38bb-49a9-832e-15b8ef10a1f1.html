  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to install the latest security updates:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Install updates for Microsoft software.</strong> Windows Server Update Services may be deployed to update most common Microsoft software in compliance with PCI DSS. Installing and configuring WSUS is an involved process that is thoroughly documented
 by Microsoft on its TechNet web site linked at the bottom of this article.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Install updates from other vendors.</strong> Usually applying vendor-supplied patches means going to the vendor's web site, downloading the latest patches, and installing them, which is often a matter of running a packaged executable on the target
 host. The procedures for applying security updates vary by vendor, though, as some vendors package their updates differently, such as compressed archives or source code patches. Please refer to your vendor's documentation or technical support for detailed
 instructions on installing their security updates. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Schedule regular updates. </strong>Add a point to the information security policy that requires critical new&nbsp;patches to be installed at least once a month. Install new security patches at least once a month.</p>
    </li>
