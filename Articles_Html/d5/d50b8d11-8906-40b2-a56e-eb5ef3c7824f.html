<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not accept file names or paths from users.&nbsp; If you must accept a file name or a path from a user, sanitize it very carefully. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Accepting file names or paths from users can result in attackers coercing your application into accessing arbitrary files and resources. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If it is unavoidable to accept a file name from a user and to then use it to acccess or store data in the file system, that file name or path must be very carefully sanitized. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>File Names.</strong> Ensure that file paths only refer to files within your application's virtual directory hierarchy if that is appropriate.&nbsp; When checking file names, obtain the full name of the file by using the <b>System.IO.Path.GetFullPath</b> method. </p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>File Paths. </strong>If you use <b>MapPath</b> to map a supplied virtual path to a physical path on the server, use the overloaded <b>Request.MapPath</b> method that accepts a <b>bool</b> parameter so that you can prevent cross-application mapping. The following code example shows this technique. </p>
        <pre>try<br />&#123;<br /> string mappedPath = Request.MapPath( inputPath.Text,<br />                                       Request.ApplicationPath, false);<br />&#125;<br />catch (HttpException)<br />&#123;<br /> // Cross-application mapping attempted <br />&#125;</pre>
        <p>The final <b>false</b> parameter prevents cross-application mapping.&nbsp; This means that a user cannot successfully supply a path that contains ".." to traverse outside of your application's virtual directory hierarchy. Any attempt to do this results in an exception of type <b>HttpException</b>. </p>
      </li>
