<h1>Description</h1><p>Insecure randomness vulnerabilities occur when a pseudo-random number generator with poor entropy is used for cryptography. With poor entropy, the results of the cryptographic algorithm being used become easier to predict, thus weakening the cryptography overall. 
</p><p>
It is important to distinguish between encryption and cryptography in general: Encryption is a subset of cryptography, and refers to scrambling stored data in a manner that can be reversed, whereas cryptography is a more general term that refers to using a certain type of  algorithm for a practical application. 
</p><p>
Insecure randomness issues affect all applications that use cryptographic algorithms that require random numbers for proper operation (which is virtually all of them). 
</p><h1>Impact</h1><p>If a pseudo-random number generator with poor entropy is used, the cryptographic scheme can be broken in a short time. The exact impact depends on the cryptographic scheme being used and its purpose. One possible scenario is when a poor source of randomness is used to generate authentication keys - in this case an attacker will be able to generate unauthorized authentication keys. Another possible scenario is when a poor source of randomness is used as a part of an encryption scheme - in that case an attacker will be able to recover encrypted data.
</p><h1>Countermeasures</h1><p>To prevent insecure randomness vulnerabilities, use a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generator.
</p><h1>Application Check</h1><p>To check for adequate protection against insecure randomness vulnerabilities, make sure that a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generator is used.
