<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that your application uses medium trust in shared hosting environments.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>In ASP.NET,&nbsp;the SQL Server managed data provider no longer demands full trust, so SQL Server database access is available to medium trust applications. If you need to isolate multiple applications on a shared server from one another, as well as&nbsp;from shared system resources, use medium trust.</p>
  <p>To enforce medium trust for all Web applications on a server, use the following configuration in the machine-level Web.config file:</p>
  <p>
    <pre>&lt;location allowOverride="false"&gt;<br />  &lt;system.web&gt;<br />   &lt;trust level="Medium" originUrl="" /&gt;<br />  &lt;/system.web&gt;<br /> &lt;/location&gt;  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>By setting <b>allowOverride="false"</b>, an individual developer is unable to override the medium trust policy setting in his or her application's Web.config file.</p>
  <p>Medium trust provides application isolation because it restricts file system access to the application's own virtual directory hierarchy, and it limits access to HTTP Web resources to a defined address or set of addresses specified by the originUrl attribute on the &lt;trust&gt; element. It also prevents access to shared system resources such as the Windows event log and registry. Additionally, Medium trust applications cannot use reflection and cannot access non-SQL Server OLE DB data sources.</p>
