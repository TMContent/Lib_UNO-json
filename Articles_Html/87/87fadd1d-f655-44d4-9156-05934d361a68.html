  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Accepts only trusted TLS certificates, if TLS is being used.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using a trusted key or certificate prevents an attacker from posing as a trusted party or substituting the key to be able to decrypt the transmission.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Identify whether TLS is used. Identify all the certificates and keys used to encrypt the transmissions. Verify that all the used keys and certificates are authorized by examining the certificates and keys and interviewing the issuing parties. Add
 all the used keys and certificates to the trusted certificates or keys list of each respective application, such as a web browser.</p>
