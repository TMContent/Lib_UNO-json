<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Protect sensitive information stored in your cloud by using encryption methods for data at rest in these services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon S3</li>
<li>Amazon EBS</li>
<li>Amazon RDS</li>
<li>Additional services with sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Data at rest requires safe storage practices to address security concerns such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accidental information disclosure</li>
<li>Data integrity compromise</li>
<li>Unintended deletion</li>
<li>Availability of infrastructure hardware and software.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When</h2>
<p>When encryption is available at the file, partition, volume, or application-level, you should use it. Some data may not be confidential, but it is simpler to enable encryption for an entire bucket or volume, for example, in order to eliminate the possibility that an intruder could use any data in your cloud.</p>
<p>Backup and replication approaches must also use encryption, or respect the encryption method already in use.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>To use encryption with your AWS resources, include the following steps as part of your management of sensitive data in the cloud:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify sensitive data.</strong> Examine your cloud architecture and services used. Look for customer data, intellectual property, and access credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Classify sensitive data.</strong> Review the list of sensitive data and prioritize the classification. Customer data and your business data are important, but the financial impact of losing customer data may be higher than losing a list of employees. Use such comparisons as well as threat level to rank and classify data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect data at rest on S3.</strong> Use permissions at the bucket or object level in combination with IAM policies. This will secure your S3 resources against unauthorized access, deletion, and disclosure. You should still encrypt data stored on S3 in addition to restricting access permissions. You can use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) to protect S3 objects. You can also implement encryption in your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect data at rest on EBS.</strong> Use Elastic Block Store (EBS) encryption on non-boot volumes. For boot volumes you will use an encryption method supported by the operating system (OS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect data at rest on RDS.</strong> Relational Database Service (RDS) offers platform-level protection for MySQL, Oracle, and MS SQL. You can add more protection at the application layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect data at rest on Glacier.</strong> Your data is always protected by server-side encryption. For an additional layer of security you can also encrypt your data before uploading to Glacier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protecting data at rest on DynamoDB.</strong> You will need to implement a data encryption layer over the standard service. This can be done at the application layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protecting data at rest on EMR.</strong> Elastic MapReduce (EMR) uses Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to create instances, which by default do not encrypt data at rest.</p>
</li>
