<h1>Description</h1><p>TLS should be used to protect any sensitive data in transit. Some applications don't use TLS even during authentication or when transmitting sensitive data, and an attacker may be able to intercept such data that is sent over the network unencrypted. This vulnerability applies to all applications that send sensitive data over the network. 
</p><h1>Impact</h1><p>Not using TLS allows attackers to intercept sensitive information using man-in-the-middle attacks. There are many different attack scenarios that are enabled by not using TLS. One common attack vector is exposed by the Firesheep tool. The Firesheep tool monitors open wireless networks for information about user sessions for some social networking web sites. Once that information has been sniffed from the network, the attacker is able to take over the user's session. Taking over the user's session allows the attacker to view the victim user's data and to impersonate him. This attack would not be possible if TLS was used by the target sites.
</p><h1>Countermeasures</h1><p>To prevent this problem, use TLS for all sensitive communications, configure TLS to use strong cipher suites, and use valid certificates. 
</p><p>
Use TLS for all sensitive communications:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="5bff1c23-47fc-46ad-84bd-130b822d9611">Encrypt Communication Links</a></li>
</ul><p>
Configure TLS to use strong cipher suites:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000507b8d">Configure TLS to Use Strong Cipher Suites</a></li>
</ul><p>
Use valid certificates:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="8df9fe45-29b6-47c6-81c5-6248930d303c">Use a Valid TLS Certificate</a></li>
</ul><h1>Application Check</h1><p>To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, ensure that TLS is used for all sensitive communications, TLS is configured to use strong cipher suites, and valid certificates are used.
</p><p>
TLS is used for all sensitive communications:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="edcb9c8f-7ab4-4b24-aa2e-f186f3903332">All Sensitive Communications Are Encrypted</a></li>
</ul><p>
TLS is configured to use strong cipher suites:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000013f66a">TLS Is Configured to Use Strong Cipher Suites</a></li>
</ul><p>
Valid certificates are used:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="e8270fbe-a9e2-4504-a4af-688d3462cb0e">A Valid TLS Certificate Is Used</a></li>
