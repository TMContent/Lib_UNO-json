<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that the dispose methods are synchronized when&nbsp;developing non-synchronized <b>Dispose</b> implementations in your application.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>If you develop non-synchronized <b>Dispose</b> implementations, the <b>Dispose</b> code could be called more than once on separate threads. The following code shows an example of this.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>void Dispose()&#123;<br />  if (null &#33;= theObject)<br />  &#123;<br />    ReleaseResources(theObject);<br />    theObject = null;<br />  &#125;<br />&#125;</pre>
  </div>
  <p>In this example, it is possible for two threads to execute the code before the first thread has set <b>theObject</b> reference to <b>null</b>. Depending on the functionality provided by the <b>ReleaseResources</b> method, security vulnerabilities could occur.</p>
