<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that the System.Net.Security.NegotiateStream class is used for a TCP channel with .NET remoting to encrypt and to authenticate callers.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Remoting applications that use the TCP channel do not by default perform authentication or encryption. In the .NET Framework, the remoting framework uses the <b>System.Net.Security.NegotiateStream</b> class to encrypt and sign the data transported over the channel and to authenticate callers. To use this feature, you can configure the &lt;<b>channel</b>&gt; element in the Machine.config file, the Web.config file, or the App.config file, depending on whether you want to apply the setting across all applications on your computer or to a specific application.</p>
  <p>The following example shows how a server specifies that authentication is required and that the channel should be protected with encryption.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;channel ref="tcp" port="1234"<br />          authenticationMode="IdentifyCallers" secure="true" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>To authenticate clients by using their domain credentials, you need to set the <b>useDefaultCredentials</b> attribute of the &lt;<b>channel</b>&gt; in the client configuration to true. The following example shows a sample client configuration.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;channel ref="tcp" useDefaultCredentials="true" secure="true"<br />          impersonationLevel="Identify" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>To use Kerberos authentication, the client must specify a service principal name (SPN). This can be done programmatically or in the client's configuration file, as shown in the following example.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;channel ref="tcp"<br />          useDefaultCredentials="true"<br />          impersonationLevel="Identify"<br />          spn="someService/somehost.com" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
