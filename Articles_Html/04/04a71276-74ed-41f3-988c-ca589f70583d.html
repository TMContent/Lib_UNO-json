  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Consider what authentication and authorizations options you have and which makes sense for your scenario.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Know your authorization options and choose the most appropriate for your scenario. First decide if you want to use resource-based or role-based authorization.&nbsp; Resource-based authorization uses ACLs on the resource to authorize the original caller.&nbsp; Role-based allows you to authorize access to service operations or resources based upon the group a user is in.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you choose to use role-based authorization then you can store your roles in Windows groups or in ASPNET roles.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<li>If you are using Active Directory then consider using Windows groups based on ease of maintenance and the fact you maintain both roles and credentials in the Active Directory store.&nbsp; If you are not using Active Directory, consider using ASPNET roles and the ASP.NET Role Provider.</li></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your authorization strategy may also be influenced by your choice of authentication:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Resource-based authorization 
<ul><li>If you are using certificates authentication you will need to map certificates to Windows groups. 
<li>If you are using username authentication you will need to perform protocol transition. 
<li>Windows authentication will work with resource-based authorization by default. 
<li>Basic authentication will work with resource-based authorization by default. 
<li>Note: You need to impersonate for resource-based authorization.<br /></li></li></li></li></li></ul><li>Role-based authorization 
<ul><li>If you are using certificates authentication you will need to map certificates to Windows groups. 
<li>If you are using username authentication with Windows groups, you will need to perform protocol transition. 
<li>Username authentication will work with ASPNET roles by default. 
<li>Windows authentication will work with Windows groups by default. 
<li>Basic authentication will work with Windows groups by default.</li></li></li></li></li></ul></li></li>
  </ul>
