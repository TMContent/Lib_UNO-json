  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Verify that your administration interfaces support role-based authorization to differentiate between content developers and operators or system administrators.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Inadequate separation of privileges causes no accountability or ability to perform per-user authorization.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This is important guideline and follow it all the time.&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If the functionality supported by the features of your application's configuration management varies based on the role of the administrator, consider authorizing each role separately by using role-based authorization. For example, the person responsible for updating a site's static content should not necessarily be allowed to change a customer's credit limit.</p>
