  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>If you need to support clients over the Internet, consider using Message Security.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Message security provides end to end security. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Consider using this guideline when you need to support clients over the Internet.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use message security when your clients are deployed over internet and you cannot rely on TLS.&nbsp; Message security provides end to end security.&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>TLS does not provide protection for the initial client-server handshake. Thus a man-in-the-middle attack can go undetected.
</li>
    <li>You have less control of the communication between the client and service across the Internet. There is a chance of having intermediaries which might break transport security.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The downside of using message security is potentially decreased performance due to the fact that each message much be encrypted individually. Large message packets can especially create lag. You can use wsHttpBinding which by default uses message security and also supports interoperability as it uses text encoding.<br /></p>
