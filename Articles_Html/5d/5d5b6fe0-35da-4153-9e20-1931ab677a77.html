<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>If you use programmatic impersonation, use structured exception handling and put the impersonation code inside <b>try</b> blocks. Use a <b>catch</b> block to handle exceptions and to prevent exceptions propagating. Use a <b>finally</b> block to ensure that the impersonation is reverted.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If your code fails to catch exceptions and your code uses impersonation, a malicious user could use exception filters to execute code that runs under the impersonated security context, even if you are reverting the impersonation in your <b>finally</b> block. This is particularly serious if your code impersonates a privileged account. If your code does not catch the exception, exception filters higher in the call stack can be executed before code in your <b>finally</b> block is executed.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This is important guideline and should be followed wehnever working with programmatic impersonation.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you use programmatic impersonation, use structured exception handling and put the impersonation code inside <b>try</b> blocks. Use a <b>catch</b> block to handle exceptions and to prevent exceptions propagating. Use a <b>finally</b> block to ensure that the impersonation is reverted, as shown in the following example.</p>
  <pre>using System.Security.Principal;<br />. . .<br />WindowsIdentity winIdentity = new WindowsIdentity("<a href="mailto:username@domainName">username@domainName</a>");<br />WindowsImpersonationContext ctx = null;<br />try<br />{</pre>
  <pre>&nbsp; ctx = winIdentity.Impersonate();<br />&nbsp; // Do work.<br />&nbsp; ...<br />}<br />// Do not let the exception propagate. Catch it here.<br />catch(Exception ex)<br />{<br />&nbsp; ...<br />}<br />finally<br />{<br />&nbsp; // Stop impersonating.<br />&nbsp; ctx.Undo();<br />}  </pre>
  <p>By using a <b>finally</b> block, you make ensure that the impersonation token is removed from the current thread, even if an exception is generated. By preventing the exception from propagating from the <b>catch</b> block, you make sure that exception filter code higher in the call stack does not execute while the thread still has an impersonation token attatched to it.</p>
