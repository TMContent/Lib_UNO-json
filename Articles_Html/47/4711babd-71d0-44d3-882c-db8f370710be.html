<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be
<em>HttpOnly</em>. In browsers that support the <em>HttpOnly</em> feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie.
 This is not a complete solution, since <em>HttpOnly</em> is not supported by all browsers. More importantly,
<em>XMLHTTPRequest</em> and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the<em> Set-Cookie</em> header in which the
<em>HttpOnly</em> flag is set.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <span>
    <p>Set the "<em>Secure</em>" flag on all sensitive cookies to protect the contents of the sensitive cookies from eavesdropping attacks. Setting the "<em>Secure</em>" flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured
 by TLS. The "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script - this measure helps reduce the potential damage of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>
  </span>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To set the "<em>Secure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags on all sensitive cookies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that TLS is available.</strong> The "<em>Secure</em>" flag forces cookies to be sent over TLS. TLS has to be available for this to work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive cookies.</strong> Session cookies should always be considered sensitive. Enumerate all cookies used by the application. Make a list of cookies that may contain sensitive information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify code that creates sensitive cookies. </strong>For each sensitive cookie in the list, find the code that creates that cookie.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set the "S<em>ecure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags for each sensitive cookie.</strong> For each piece of code that creates a sensitive cookie, add code that sets the "S<em>ecure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags for the cookie.&nbsp;Make sure,
 that when the <i>Secure </i>attribute is set for a cookie, it is in response to a request that was made over HTTPS and not HTTP.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure the platform.</strong> Many platform have configuration options that allow setting the "<em>Secure"</em> and "<em>HTTPOnly"</em> flags for session cookies. Please refer to your platform's documentation for information about whether this
 functionality is available and how to use it.</p>
