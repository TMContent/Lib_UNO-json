<h1>Applies To</h1><p>Applications that require multiple layers of authentication.
</p><h1>Description</h1><p>An attacker may be able to exploit the trust relationship between two or more systems, or elements of systems, if that trust is improperly assigned. All complex systems have many different trust relationships, and it is easy for that trust to get out of sync. Furthermore, trust relationships can allow an attacker to leapfrog between systems, exploiting the trust they gain by compromising one system to extend their hold to other systems. Trust relationships are sometimes specified too weakly, resulting in trust relationships where a host is trusted simply because of an IP address or other spoof-able identifier. These types of trust relationships are particularly fruitful for attackers.
</p><h1>Impact</h1><ul><li>Privilege escalation: An attacker may use a trust relationship to piggyback into other systems to execute commands or read/write/update/delete data on other systems.</li>
<li>Information disclosure: With improper relationships, an attacker may be able to read sensitive information to which they should not have access.</li>
</ul><h1>Vulnerabilities</h1><ul><li>Failure to constrain trust: Any time trust is granted in an overly broad way, vulnerability issues arise. Applications that do not recognize the cases when they are trusting other systems are a particular issue here.</li>
<li>Identification without authentication: Identifying another system based on IP, Mac address, fingerprint, DNS name, or other information which only provides weak identification can allow an attacker to exploit that trust to gain access to those systems.</li>
<li>Improperly trusting a client: Trusting a client to do no evil sets the stage for an attacker to break into that system and choose malicious actions to perform.</li>
</ul><h1>Countermeasures</h1><ul><li>Develop a threat model: A threat model can specify all the places where entities should trust one another. These relationships can then be analyzed for correctness and their implementations can be audited.</li>
<li>Authenticate all clients: All clients must be securely authenticated using proper techniques.</li>
<li>Do not base trust on spoof-able information: Do not trust a client or server based on IP, Mac address, or other spoof-able information. Require all clients to be strongly authenticated.</li>
