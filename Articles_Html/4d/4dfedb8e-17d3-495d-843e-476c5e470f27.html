<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Always encode output which contains untrusted data appropriately for the context in which it will be used. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>This prevents potentially malicious script tags from being interpreted as code by the client's browser</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Whenever your application will echo untrusted input to the client use this guideline.&amp;nbsp; Untrusted input can come from the user, from the client, from a database, or from untrusted code that your application calls into.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you write output that includes user input or data from a shared database or a local file that you do not trust, encode it.&amp;nbsp; Echoing input directly back to the user makes your application vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks, among other problems.&amp;nbsp; Encoding the data ensures that it is treated as literal text and not as script.&amp;nbsp; You can use the <b>Microsoft.Security.ApplicationAntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</b> method.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, if you write URLs that might contain unsafe characters because they have been constructed from input data or data from a shared database, use <b>Microsoft.Security.ApplicationAntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode</b> to make them safe. </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note</b> &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Make sure that you encode data at the last possible opportunity before the data is returned to the client.&amp;nbsp; If you encode any earlier than this, you may not know the exact context that the data will be used in, and hence the format you need to encode into.&amp;nbsp; Also, early encoding of some data can result in double encoding problems. </p>
