<h1>Description</h1><p>Poorly handled error conditions might allow attacks to go unnoticed. Checking error conditions helps the application to determine if something out of the ordinary is happening and to log that information. Log information helps administrators determine when an attack is taking place and provides information about the attack. 
</p><p>
Poorly handled error condition flaws can occur in any type of application. 
</p><h1>Impact</h1><p>Poorly handled error conditions can result in other, more serious vulnerabilities. A poorly handled error condition might not actually give any advantage to the attacker. However, if the application contains a lot of code that can produce poorly handled errors, it creates a fertile field for the attacker to look for vulnerabilities. 
</p><h1>Countermeasures</h1><p>To prevent unchecked error conditions, use structured exception handling, use a global exception handler for unhandled exceptions, and log error information.

</ul><h1>Application Check</h1><p>To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, verify that structured exception handling is used, a global exception handler is used for unhandled exceptions, and error information is logged.
