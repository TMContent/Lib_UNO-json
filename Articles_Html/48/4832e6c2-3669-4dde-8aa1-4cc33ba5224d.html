<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Avoid writing code that accepts file or path input from the caller. Instead, use fixed file names and locations when your code reads and writes data.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Accepting file names or paths from users can result in attackers coercing your application into accessing arbitrary files and resources. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>You should never accept a file name or path from a user under any circumstances.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you need to store a file from a user, store it in a database or other non-filesystem data store.&nbsp; Keep the name the user provided as a reference to the file, but do not use it as any form of canonical name.</p>
  <p>If your application has to accept input file names, file paths, or URL paths, you need to validate that the path is in the correct format and that it points to a valid location within the context of your application. Failure to do this can result in attackers persuading your application into accessing arbitrary files and resources. </p>
  <h2>Validating File Paths</h2>
  <p>To prevent a malicious user manipulating your code's file operations, avoid writing code that accepts user-supplied file or path input. For example: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you must accept file names as input, use the full name of the file by using <b>System.IO.Path.GetFileName</b>. <li>If you must accept file paths as input, use the full file path by using <b>System.IO.Path.GetFullPath</b>.</li></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Using MapPath to Prevent Cross Application Mapping</h2>
  <p>If you use <b>MapPath</b> to map a supplied virtual path to a physical path on the server, use the overload of <b>Request.MapPath</b> that accepts a <b>bool</b> parameter so that you can prevent cross-application mapping. The following code example shows this technique.</p>
  <pre>try<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; string mappedPath = Request.MapPath( inputPath.Text, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request.ApplicationPath, false);<br />&#125;<br />catch (HttpException)<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; // Cross-application mapping attempted<br />&#125;   </pre>
  <p>The final <b>false</b> parameter prevents cross-application mapping. This means that a user cannot successfully supply a path that contains <b>".."</b> to traverse outside of your application's virtual directory hierarchy. Any attempt to do this results in an exception of type <b>HttpException</b>.</p>
  <p>If you use server controls, you can use the <b>Control.MapPathSecure</b> method to retrieve the physical path to which the virtual path is mapped. <b>Control.MapPathSecure</b> uses code access security and throws an <b>HttpException</b> if the server control does not have permissions to read the resulting mapped file. For more information, see <b>Control.MapPathSecure</b> in the .NET Framework SDK documentation.</p>
