<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that logs are sent to a centralized log server.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Sending logs to a centralized log server makes it simpler to secure and monitor logs on a network with multiple log-generating devices.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to verify that functionality to send logs to a remote server is implemented:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine documentation. </strong>If remote logging is implemented, it should be documented. Review documentation for information about remote logging functionality.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Identify the logging subsystem.</strong> The logging subsystem should provide an API that allows generating log entries from application code. If this API or the logging subsystem don't exist, write them. Make a list of functions that may be used to generate log entries.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Review the logging subsystem.</strong> Use the list of logging functions and trace them to determine where the log entries end up. Verify the code exists that sends log entries to a remote log server.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to implement sending logs to a centralized log server:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Design the logging subsystem.</strong> Design and implement a class or library specifically for logging. When designing the logging subsystem, consider sending logs to a remote log server. Consider the following factors when designing the logging subsystem:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Log throttling<li>Logging important event details<li>Logging important security operations<li>Logging important business operations<li>Monitoring the use of privileged accounts<li>Logging authentication events<li>Avoiding including sensitive information in logs<li>Logging unusual activity</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose a protocol for communicating with the log server.</strong> The Internet standard for sending logs remotely is syslog (RFC 5424). It is recommended to use syslog, because it is supported by most centralized logging solutions.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Implement the logging subsystem.</strong> Write code that generates log entries and sends them to a remote log server via your protocol of choice.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
