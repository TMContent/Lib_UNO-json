  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Install firewalls between any wireless networks and the cardholder data environment. Configure these firewalls to only allow traffic necessary for business purposes.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Wireless access points may be compromised and an attacker may be using them. To prevent sensitive data from leaking out through a compromised wireless network, a firewall should be used to filter traffic between the cardholder data environment and the wireless
 network.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Install and configure a firewall between each wireless network and the cardholder data environment. Refer to the vendorâ€™s documentation or technical support for installation and configuration instructions.</p>
