  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The information security policy should define acceptable use of technology.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check that usage policies are defined in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that management approval is required:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies in the information security policy to verify that they require management authorization to use the technology.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check that&nbsp;authentication is required:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies to verify that they require authentication to use the technology.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check that an authorized device list is required:</strong> Examine the security documentation to verify that it includes a list of devices and users authorized to use them.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check that labeling is required:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies to verify that they require devices to be labeled with information about the owner, contact information, and purpose.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check that acceptable use is required:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies to verify that they require acceptable use.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that acceptable network locations are defined:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies to verify that they require acceptable network locations.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check that a list of approved products is required:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies to verify that they require a list of approved products.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that remote access time-outs are required:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies to verify that they require idle remote access sessions to be disconnected automatically after some period of time.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that handling of vendor remote access is defined:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies to verify that they require remote access accounts for vendors to be only enabled when in use.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that remote access downloads are forbidden:</strong> Examine the acceptable use policies to verify that they prohibit downloading cardholder data over remote access connections to local storage media.
</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to define usage policies in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Require&nbsp;management approval:</strong> Add a point that requires explicit management authorization to use the technologies.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Require authentication:</strong> Add a point that requires users to be authenticated with a password or another security mechanism to use the technologies.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Require an authorized device list:</strong>&nbsp; Add a point that requires a list of all devices and personnel authorized to use them.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Require&nbsp;labeling:</strong>&nbsp; Add a point that requires devices to be labeled with owner, contact information, and purpose.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Require acceptable use:</strong>&nbsp; Add a point that requires acceptable uses for the technology. This requirement seems redundant, but it is actually explicit in demanding that technology be used only in its intended purpose.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define acceptable network locations:</strong>&nbsp; Add a point that requires acceptable network locations for the technology. Acceptable network locations are the networks secured in compliance with PCI DSS. For example, a laptop from the cardholder
 data environment may not be connected to the Internet directly. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Require&nbsp;a list of approved products:</strong>&nbsp; Add a point that requires a list of company-approved products. Make a list of company-approved products and add it to the information security documentation.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Require&nbsp;remote access time-outs:</strong>&nbsp; Add a point that requires idle remote sessions to be disconnected automatically after a certain amount of time.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define handling of&nbsp;vendor remote access accounts:&nbsp;</strong> Add a point that requires remote access accounts for vendors to be enabled only when needed and disabled immediately thereafter.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Prohibit&nbsp;remote access downloads:</strong>&nbsp; Add a point that forbids downloading cardholder data to local storage media over a remote access connection.</p>
    </li>
