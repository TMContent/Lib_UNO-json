<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Define the different types of users and create specific roles for them. When authorizing access to a resource, build the security checks on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.</p>
<p>Application roles allow multiple users to play the same role and provides a clear way to manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.</p>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>The following segment illustrates a JAAS policy. Because the application does not enforce role-based security, it has a policy entry for each separate user; therefore, changing the users' access rights can be quite difficult as each user needs to be modified individually.</p>
<pre><code>grant Principal application.auth.UserToken &quot;joe&quot;
{
  permission java.security.SecurityPermission &quot;AccessApp&quot;;
};
grant Principal application.auth.UserToken &quot;steve&quot;
{
  permission java.security.SecurityPermission &quot;AccessApp&quot;;
};
grant Principal application.auth.UserToken &quot;julie&quot; 
{
  permission java.security.SecurityPermission &quot;AccessApp&quot;;
};
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>The following segment illustrates a JAAS policy. Because the application enforces role-based security, it has a policy entry for each group of users; therefore changing the users' access rights is easy as only the group needs to be modified.</p>
<pre><code>grant Principal application.auth.GroupToken &quot;users&quot;
{
  permission java.security.SecurityPermission &quot;AccessApp&quot;;
};
</code></pre>
