  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Make authentication and authorization policies configurable, rather than hard-coded.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Authentication and authorization policies should be configurable to make it possible for the customers to adapt the application's security to their environment.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To make authentication and authorization policies configurable:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify application requirements.</strong> Define options for configuring access control and authentication policies. At the very least, there should be an administration panel for managing user accounts, and a page for users to manage their own accounts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Make authentication and authorization code configurable.</strong> Find all code responsible for authentication and authorization features. Modify this code to read settings defined in the application requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Design the administrative pages.</strong> Design the pages to be used for configuring access control and authentication policies based on the requirements for your application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Implement the administration interface. </strong>Write code for the administrative pages to interface with authentication and authorization code. The administration interface should be able to read and write settings to a secure location, where the authentication and authorization code may access them. The saved settings should be protected with access controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure and tampering.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
