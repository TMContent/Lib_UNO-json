<p>##What to Do##</p>
<p>Implement load balancing by reviewing currently-available products and techniques. Choose a solution that satisfies business case. Use performance metrics to gauge the effectiveness of load balancing.</p>
<p>##Why##</p>
<p>Load balancing is usually used for performance reasons and to mitigate Denial-of-Service attacks.</p>
<p>##How##</p>
<p>Begin with these steps for a secure load-balancing implementation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Review available load-balancing options.</strong> Make a list of load-balancing products, and determine what features are provided, such as: request routing, URL rewriting and redirecting, health checks, and auto scaling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose load-balancing solution.</strong> One solution may not provide the necessary features for your application. For example, URL rewriting and redirecting may be built-in, but auto scaling is missing. You may need to integrate different products in order to implement 100% of your security design features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configure load-balancing solution.</strong> Use the vendor's instruction to setup the load balancing solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Test load balancing solution.</strong> Before going live, test the load balancer. Use the vendor's instructions, if available, or contact them for information on how to test their solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make adjustments to configuration.</strong>  If any issues are discovered, correct them before deploying the solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitor performance.</strong> Use the vendor-provided tools to monitor load-balancing performance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
