<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> HTML5</li>
</ul><h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Check that the directive <em>Strict-Transport-Security       max-age=(time value)</em> is present in the HTTP Server Response.
</p> <h2>Why</h2><p>The Strict-Transport-Security header instructs the browser to communicate with the server only via HTTPS, a secure communication tunnel that prevents eavesdropping. Without the header, there is no way for the browser to “know” that a web page should be accessed over HTTPS. This leaves open the possibility of using standard, unencrypted HTTP, whether through a malicious link or direct URL access. 
</p><h2>How To Check</h2><ol><li>  <strong>Check that the <em>mod_header</em> module is enabled in the <em>httpd.conf</em> file</strong>. Find the <em>httpd.conf</em> file on your filesystem. This file is usually located in <em> /etc/httpd/httpd.conf</em> (consult your Web Server distribution documentation for the exact file location). Make sure that the line <em>LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so</em> appears in the file; this line enables <em>mod_header</em>. Apache Web servers must be compiled with support for <em>mod_header</em> for this to work.</li>
<li> <strong>Check that the HSTS Header appears in the <em>httpd.conf</em> file</strong>. View the <em>httpd.conf</em> file and make sure that the line <em>Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=7776000;includeSubDomains"</em> is present. This line enables HTTP Strict Transport Security.</li>
<li> <strong>Reload or restart the Web Server configuration</strong>. If you made changes to the <em>httpd.conf</em> file, stop and restart the Web server. For example, with Apache2, execute the command <em>/etc/init.d/apache2 stop</em> to stop the server and <em>/etc/init.d/apache2 start</em> to restart it.</li>
</ol><h2>How To Fix</h2><p>Note that, as of this writing, the latest releases of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera all support the HSTS header. However, Internet Explorer does not.
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Enable the <em>mod_header</em> module in the <em>httpd.conf</em> configuration file (if it is not already enabled).</strong> For example, if you are using Apache Web Server, first enable
<em>LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so</em></li>
<li> <strong>Add the HSTS header to the <em>httpd.conf</em> configuration file.</strong> Include the required directive <em>max-age</em>. This specifies the time, in seconds, that a compliant browser will abide by forced HTTPS, even in the event a standard HTTP connection is attempted. For example, in the Apache <em>httpd.conf</em> configuration file, add the following line: <em>Header always append Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=7776000"</em>. This directive instructs the browser to connect only via HTTPS for the next 90 days. The server will inject this header information into each application page rendered.</li>
<li> <strong>Reload or restart the web server configuration.</strong> The first time the user connects to your website using HTTPS, the browser reads the HSTS header, including the <em>max-age</em> directive. The browser will know it should connect only via HTTPS for the specified <em>max-age</em> time period.</li>
