<h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that TLS is used to protect communications.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Using TLS to secure network communications prevents eavesdropping attacks.
</p><h2>How to Check</h2><p>To verify that TLS is used to protect network connections:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify all communications performed by the application.</strong> Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.</li>
<li> <strong>Review communication security requirements.</strong> Examine which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.</li>
<li> <strong>Identify code that uses the network.</strong> Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.</li>
<li> <strong>Verify that TLS is used to protect network connections.</strong> Examine code that is responsible for network connections that need to be encrypted and make sure that it uses TLS.</li>
</ol><h2>How to Fix</h2><p>To use TLS to protect network connections:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify all communications performed by the application.</strong> Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.</li>
<li> <strong>Define communication security requirements.</strong> Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.</li>
<li> <strong>Identify code that uses the network.</strong> Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.</li>
<li> <strong>Add code that uses TLS.</strong> There are multiple methods for using TLS in Android to choose from based on application requirements. Using the <em>SSLSocketFactory</em> class is one of the most common solutions.</li>
