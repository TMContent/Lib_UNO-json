<h1>Applies To</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>The &lt;<em>sessionState</em>&gt; and &lt;<em>identity</em>&gt; elements in the <em>Machine.config</em> and <em>Web.config</em> files have <em>userName</em> and <em>password</em> attributes. If you store credentials in these sections, encrypt them by using one of the protected configuration providers.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>
    <em>Machine.config</em> and <em>Web.config</em> files typically contain sensitive resource access credentials (e.g., <em>userName</em> and <em>password</em> attributes) As a precautionary measure, they should not be stored in plaintext, because an attacker that can compromise a server will be able to read those connection strings unless they are adequately protected.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use this guideline on any application that stores credentials in the <em>Machine.config</em> or <em>Web.config</em> files.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>In ASP.NET&nbsp;applications, there are two libraries that provide encryption facilities for connection strings, DPAPI and RSA. If your application is deployed in a Web farm, you should use the RSA protected configuration provider due to the ease with which RSA keys can be exported. Otherwise you should use the DPAPI protected configuration provider.</p>
