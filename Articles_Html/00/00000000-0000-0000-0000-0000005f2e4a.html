<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> HTML5</li>
</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>When using WebSockets, connect with Transport Layer Security (TLS).
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Just as TLS protects and encrypts the communication tunnel in HTTP, it can encrypt a WebSockets tunnel to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. (By default, the communication tunnel with the WebSocket protocol is not encrypted.) 
</p><h2>When</h2><p>Use this guideline for applications that employ the WebSocket protocol and need to protect sensitive data.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>The WebSockets protocol specification is built on HTTP. With that in mind:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Enable security certificates and keys.</strong> Consult your web server documentation to ensure that your web site produces a valid certificate with HTTPS connections.</li>
<li> <strong>Enable TLS on the WebSocket server.</strong> The configuration may vary depending upon the Websocket server implementation in use. </li>
<li> <strong>Connect the client to the WebSocket server and ensure connections to the WebSocket are secure.</strong> When connecting to HTML5 web applications, ensure that client browsers connect with HTTPS. Note that the code accessing the WebSocket server should use the wss protocol, which is basically ws over TLS. As such, use <tt>wss://&lt;url&gt;</tt> instead of the typical <tt>ws://&lt;url&gt;</tt> in the HTML5 application code. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Problem Example</h2><p>Below is a client-side code connection to a WebSocket server. The connection uses standard ws over standard, unencrypted HTTP. An intruder who has access to the communication stream over the network could easily intercept the communication.
</p><p>
Client Connection:
</p><pre>

$("#open").click (function (evt) {
evt.preventDefault();

var host = ‘example.com’;
var port = ‘8887’;
var uri = ‘very_private’;

ws = new WebSocket("ws://” + host + “:” + port + “/” + uri );

ws.onmessage = function(evt) {alert("Non encrypted message has been received”)};
ws.onclose = function(evt) { alert("Non encrypted connection is closed"); };
ws.onopen = function(evt) { alert(“Non encrypted connection has opened”) };
});

</pre><p>
<br></p><h2>Solution Example</h2><p>Below is a client-side code connection to a WebSocket server using wss, which takes advantage of TLS over HTTP port 443. This change makes it much more difficult for an intruder to intercept the communication tunnel.
</p><p>
Client Connection:
</p><pre>

$("#open").click(function(evt) {
evt.preventDefault();

var host = ‘example.com’;
var port = ‘8887’;
var uri = ‘very_private’;

ws = new WebSocket("wss://” + host + “:” + port + “/” + uri );
ws.onmessage = function(evt) {alert("TLS message has been received”)};
ws.onclose = function(evt) { alert("TLS connection is closed"); };
ws.onopen = function(evt) { alert(“TLS connection has opened”) };
});

</pre><p>
When the handshake is performed using wss, you’ll see the typical handshake for TLS over port 443 to establish the secure connection.
