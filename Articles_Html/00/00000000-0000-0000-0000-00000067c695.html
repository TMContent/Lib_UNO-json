<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.</li>
</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network. Using TLS is the simplest way to protect the authentication process.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Encrypting authentication credentials sent over the network helps prevent various man-in-the-middle attacks, such as spoofing or hijacking.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>To encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.</strong> Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication. However, there are other options available, such as certificates. </li>
<li> <strong>Identify the authentication code.</strong> Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both endpoints need to support TLS. </li>
<li> <strong>Encrypt authentication credentials in transit.</strong> Use TLS to protect authentication credentials in transit. The server should be configured to only accept authentication credentials via TLS. The iOS <em>NSURLRequest</em> and <em>NSURLConnection</em> classes support TLS and should be sufficient for many common authentication scenarios.</li>
