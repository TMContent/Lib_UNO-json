<h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that strong session identifiers are used.
</p><h2>How to Check</h2><p>To make sure that strong session identifiers are used:
</p> <ol>
<li> <strong>Load the application.</strong> Open the application in a web browser. Log in to the application. Any other way to start a session is okay, but logging in is a pretty sure way to start a session for any reasonably designed application.</li>
<li> <strong>Examine the session identifier.</strong> Use the browser plug-in or settings page that allows viewing the cookies. Examine the session cookie.</li>
<li> <strong>Review application code.</strong> Review the application code that handles session state. Make sure that the code either generates strong session IDs or the platform is configured to generate strong session IDs automatically.</li>
</ol><h2>How to Fix</h2><p>Most platform-provided session management implementations use sufficiently strong session IDs by default. Examine your platform's configuration settings to make sure the strength of the session IDs has not been degraded by inappropriate settings.
