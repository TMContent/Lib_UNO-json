<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> iOS applications that handle sensitive data.</li>
</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Do not log sensitive data.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>If sensitive data is logged, it may be recovered by an attacker if the device is lost or compromised.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>To prevent logging of sensitive data:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify sensitive data.</strong> Make a list of all sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:<ul>
<li> Passwords</li>
<li> Encryption keys</li>
<li> Personal information</li></ul></li>
<li> <strong>Review logging code.</strong> Identify code that generates log entries by searching for <em>NSLog()</em> function calls. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries. If necessary, rewrite this code in a way that does not log sensitive data. If <em>NSLog()</em> calls are necessary for debugging, they can be conditionally commented out using <em>#define</em> directives.</li>
</ol>
