<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> Java</li>
</ul><h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that data sent to the user in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>If the application accepts user input and includes such input in HTTP response headers the application will be vulnerable to response splitting vulnerability unless headers are URL-encoded or data is sanitized. Attackers can execute a cross site scripting attack by forcing your application to send carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) followed by malicious content to the users browser. Because CRLF is a response header separator and CRLF CRLF separates headers from the body,  the browser sees attackers content as legitimate. 
</p><h2>How to Check</h2><p>To verify that data in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.</strong> Search your code for calls to <em>HttpServletResponse.AddHeader</em> and for <em>HttpServletResponse.AddCookie</em> to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.</li>
<li> <strong>Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is validated.</strong> Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is passed through positive validation routines before being included in HTTP response headers.</li>
<li> <strong>Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded.</strong> Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is URL-encoded using <em>java.net.URLEncoder</em> class before being included in HTTP response headers.</li>
</ol><h2>How to Fix</h2><p>To URL-encode data in HTTP Response headers:</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.</strong> Search your code for calls to <em> HttpServletResponse.AddHeader</em> and for <em>HttpServletResponse.AddCookie</em> to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.</li>
<li> <strong>Validate all data included in HTTP response headers.</strong> Use positive validation routines to check all data that gets included in HTTP response headers.</li>
<li> <strong>URL-encode all data included in HTTP response headers.</strong> Use <em>java.net.URLEncoder</em> class to URL-encode data that gets includes in HTTP response headers.</li>
