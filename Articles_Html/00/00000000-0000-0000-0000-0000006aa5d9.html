<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> iOS applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.</li>
</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Disable the use of self-signed TLS certificates.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Allowing the use of self-signed TLS certificates enables some types of man-in-the-middle attacks.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>Self-signed TLS certificates are not allowed by default. Do not allow them. Avoid using the <em>allowsAnyHTTPSCertificateForHost</em> method in production releases, because it allows self-signed TLS certificates. Do not use the <em>continueWithoutCredentialForAuthenticationChallenge</em> selector within the <em>didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge</em> delegate method of <em>NSURLConnection</em> objects, because it enables self-signed TLS certificates.
