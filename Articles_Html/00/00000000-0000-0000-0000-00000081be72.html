<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> iOS applications that use URL handlers.</li>
</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Avoid using URL handlers for sensitive operations.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>URL handlers may be abused in Cross-Site Scripting attacks. If URL handlers are used for sensitive operations, such sensitive operations may be exploited in Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>To avoid using URL handlers for sensitive operations:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify all URL handlers used by the application.</strong> Examine the application .plist file for <em>URL Types</em> defined by the application. These <em>URL Types</em> correspond to URL handlers used by the application.</li>
<li> <strong>Identify the operations associated with the URL handlers.</strong> The developers should know what each <em>URL Type</em> is responsible for. Consider each one and decide if it is safe to keep.</li>
<li> <strong>Remove dangerous URL handlers.</strong> Sometimes URL handlers are used for testing. Remove any URL handlers that may be too dangerous from the production release.</li>
<li> <strong>Verify the origin of the URL request</strong>. Use the <em>openURL</em> method to make sure the URL request came from within the application itself or from a trusted application for any remaining URL handlers.</li>
</ol>
