<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> Android applications that access resources on a remote server.</li>
</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Enumerate the different types of users and create specific roles for them. When authorizing access to a resource, build the security checks on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Application roles allow administrators to group users into categories that need the same level of privileges. The mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>Use the following steps when designing role-based security:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Understand the different types of users.</strong> Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they will use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a spreadsheet mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this spreadsheet to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this spreadsheet.</li>
<li> <strong>Establish the roles.</strong> Define which resources can be accessed by each role. Place access control checks at the appropriate locations in your application.</li>
<li> <strong>Manage the users.</strong> Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should enforce the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user.</li>
