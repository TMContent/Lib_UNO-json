<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> HTML5</li>
</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Use the Strict-Transport-Security response header to enforce secure communication with the browser via HTTPS. This header is often referred to as HTTP Strict Transport Security, or simply HSTS.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>The Strict-Transport-Security header instructs the browser to communicate with the server only via HTTPS, a secure communication tunnel that prevents eavesdropping. Without the header, there is no way for the browser to “know” that a web page should be accessed over HTTPS. This leaves open the possibility of using standard, unencrypted HTTP whether through a malicious link or direct URL access. 
</p><h2>When</h2><p>Use this guideline when implementing HTML5 web applications that transmit confidential data.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>Note that, as of this writing, the latest releases of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera all support the HSTS header. However, Internet Explorer does not.
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Enable the <em>mod_header</em> module in the <em>httpd.conf</em> configuration file (if it is not already enabled).</strong> For example, if you are using Apache Web Server, first enable
<em>LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so</em></li>
<li> <strong>Add the HSTS header to the <em>httpd.conf</em> configuration file.</strong> Include the required directive <em>max-age</em>. This specifies the time, in seconds, that a compliant browser will abide by forced HTTPS, even in the event a standard HTTP connection is attempted. For example, in the Apache <em>httpd.conf</em> configuration file, add the following line: <em>Header always append Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=7776000"</em>. This directive instructs the browser to connect only via HTTPS for the next 90 days. The server will inject this header information into each application page rendered.</li>
<li> <strong>Reload or restart the web server configuration.</strong> The first time the user connects to your website using HTTPS, the browser reads the HSTS header, including the <em>max-age</em> directive. The browser will know it should connect only via HTTPS for the specified <em>max-age</em> time period.</li>
</ol><h2>Problem Example</h2><p>Example.com is a popular stock-trading site that handles confidential financial information for its users. In this scenario, it is the intention that all requests from users are sent using HTTPS. However, no Strict-Transport-Security response header is sent from the Example.com server.
</p><p>
A hacker at a coffee shop uses his laptop to intercept all unencrypted traffic on the local wireless network. A user visits the coffee shop, and clicks a link to log in to the secure Example.com website. However, the link is <a href="http://www.example.com/login.php">http://www.example.com/login.php</a> instead of <a href="https://www.example.com/login.php">https://www.example.com/login.php</a>. Though the user is visiting the correct website, the hacker can eavesdrop, because the communication tunnel is unencrypted.
</p><pre>

&lt;a href="http://www.example.com/login.php"&gt; Click here &lt;/a&gt; to login securely connect to example.com

</pre><p>
Even though the verbiage indicates a secure connection, the hyperlink clearly is not secure.

<br></p><h2>Solution Example</h2><p>To correct the situation, the developers at Example.com include the Strict-Transport-Security response header. In the configuration file of their Apache 2 server, they enable <em>mod_header</em>, and then add:
</p><pre>

Header always append Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=7776000 " 

</pre><p>
Assuming that the user has logged in previously to Example.com, the browser will now detect that the connection should be HTTPS and connect securely.
