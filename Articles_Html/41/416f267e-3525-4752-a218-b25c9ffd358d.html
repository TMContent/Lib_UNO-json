<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>If you create a class that implements the <b>ISerializable</b> interface, which allows your object to be serialized, you can add a permission demand to your <b>ISerializable.GetObjectData</b> implementation to authorize the code that is attempting to serialize your object. This is particularly important if your code supports partial trust callers. </p>
  <p>For example, the following code fragment uses a <b>System.Security.Permissions.StrongNameIdentityPermission</b> attribute to help ensure that only code signed with a particular private key, which corresponds to the public key in the demand, can serialize the object's state. </p>
  <pre>using System.Diagnostics;...<br />&#91;StrongNameIdentityPermission(SecurityAction.Demand,<br />                              PublicKey="00240000048...97e85d098615")&#93;<br />public override void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info,<br />                                    StreamingContext context)  </pre>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the .NET Framework, any fully trusted assembly will satisfy any demand, including a link demand for an identity permission, such as <b>System.Security.Permissions.StrongNameIdentityPermission</b> which the assembly does not satisfy.</blockquote>
