  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Deploy and configure an anti-virus solution on all computer systems that are commonly affected by malware.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A properly configured anti-virus solution may stop large scale automated attacks.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to deploy an anti-virus in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose an effective anti-virus. </strong>An anti-virus package usually includes an engine and signature databases, and this functionality is largely determined by the anti-virus engine being recent, although both components have to be kept up-to-date
 to deal with the latest threats. The ability to prevent malware threats largely depends on an anti-virus component that stays loaded in memory.&nbsp;An anti-virus should be able to detect, remove, and protect against all known types of malware, including viruses,
 trojans, worms, spyware, adware, and rootkits.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Install&nbsp;the anti-virus.</strong> Identify the systems that are commonly affected by malware that have anti-virus solutions available. Such systems are typically Windows or Mac OSX based. Install the anti-virus by following vendor's instructions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure logging. </strong>Please consider getting an anti-virus that is compatible with the log server because this will make the proper log management procedures required by PCI DSS a lot simpler. Configure the anti-virus to send logs and alerts
 to the log server.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure automatic updates. </strong>Configure the anti-virus to perform automatic updates. An anti-virus should be able to update its engine and signatures automatically, which often requires purchasing a license to have access to these updates
 for a period of time, typically a year. Most anti-viruses have a control panel in the administration interface that includes an option to enable and configure the frequency of automatic updates. Some anti-virus packages have a control panel on the systems
 where they are deployed while some anti-virus suites offer a centralized control panel. The number of options offered by the anti-virus interface is usually small enough that a person with an IT background can figure out what all of them are and how to use
 them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure automatic scanning. </strong>Configure the scheduler to perform automatic scans. An anti-virus should be able to perform regular automatic scans. Most anti-virus packages include a scheduler that allows configuring the frequency and type
 of automated scans. The types of scans usually include a "full scan" and a "quick scan." A "full scan" typically scans all the attached storage media for known threats and usually takes too long to be practical. A "quick scan" scans the most common locations
 for malware to hide in&nbsp;and is sufficient for most applications, although an occasional "full scan" may be a good idea. The administration interface typically has an option to set the type and schedule automatic scans.
