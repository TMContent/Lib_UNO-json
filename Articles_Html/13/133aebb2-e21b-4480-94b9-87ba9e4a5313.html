<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 6.5 </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Develop applications using industry-standard secure coding guidelines. Train the development staff in secure coding techniques.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that you develop web applications using secure coding guidelines:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Document the software development processes. </strong>Design and document the development processes for applications. The actual processes depend on the application(s) and the environment. Include a requirement to train the development staff in secure
 software development practices. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Train the development staff in secure programming guidelines.&nbsp;</strong>TeamProfessor&nbsp;courses&nbsp;provide the knowledge required to&nbsp;develop secure applications.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Prevent the&nbsp;vulnerabilities explicitly mentioned by PCI DSS in your environment.
</strong>Determine if and how each type of vulnerability applies to your application(s), and develop processes for preventing each type of&nbsp;vulnerabilities. Design mitigation measures for each applicable type of vulnerability. See TeamMentor articles for help
 with mitigating each individual type of vulnerabilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Injection flaws, especially SQL injection </li>
        <li>Buffer overflows </li>
        <li>Insecure cryptographic storage </li>
        <li>Insecure communications </li>
        <li>Improper error handling </li>
        <li>All serious discovered vulnerabilities </li>
        <li>Cross-site scripting </li>
        <li>Improper access control </li>
        <li>Cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
