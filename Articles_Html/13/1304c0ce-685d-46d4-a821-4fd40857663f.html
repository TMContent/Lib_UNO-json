<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>If you need to call the <b>CodeAccessPermission</b>.<b> Assert</b> method to prevent a demand from propagating beyond the current stack frame, consider demanding an alternate permission to authorize the calling code before calling <b>CodeAccessPermission</b>.<b> Assert</b>. For example, if you call an unmanaged library and need to assert the unmanaged code permission, consider demanding another built-in or custom permission first. </p>
  <p>If you only need to call <b>Assert</b> to satisfy the demands of a single method that your code calls, then place <b>Assert</b> prior to the method call. Then immediately call the <b>RevertAssert</b> method to keep the assertion window as small as possible, and to ensure that any subsequent code your method calls does not inadvertently succeed because <b>Assert</b> is still in effect. A common practice is to place the call to <b>RevertAssert</b> in a <b>finally</b> block to ensure that it always gets called, even in the event of an exception. </p>
