
<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Consider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory: Double check that your buffer is as large as you specify. When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as
<em>strncpy()</em>, be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string. Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure you are not in danger of writing past the allocated
 space. If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions.</p>
