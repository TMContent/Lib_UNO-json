<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use the <b>requireSSL</b> attribute to restrict authentication cookies to HTTPS connections only. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Sending cookies out exclusively over SSL makes it much harder for an attacker to sniff the cookie values off the wire.&amp;nbsp; If an attacker can get a copy of an authentication cookie, they can potentially emulate that user, compromising their account. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All systems which use authentication cookies should use SSL for those cookies if possible.&amp;nbsp; Systems which deal with any personally identifiable information or monetary transaction should use SSL in all circumstances without exception. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Set the <b>secure</b> property of the authentication cookie to ensure that browsers only send authentication cookies over HTTPS connections.&amp;nbsp; By using SSL, you prevent an attacker from capturing the authentication cookie to gain spoofed access to your application.&amp;nbsp; Set the <b>secure</b> property by using <b>requireSSL="true"</b> on the <b>&lt;forms&gt;</b> element as shown here. </p>
  <pre>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<br />        requireSSL="true" ... /&gt;</pre>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An online brokerage provides a large amount of reference content.&amp;nbsp; As this content is not specific to any user and is publicly available, it is not protected by SSL for performance reasons like the trading interface is.&amp;nbsp; However, the site is not configured to restrict authentication cookies to SSL only, so they're sent with all requests.&amp;nbsp; An attacker positions themself on the same network segment as a user (someone using the public network in an internet cafe), sniffs the user's traffic, steals their cookie, and uses it to access their accounts.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An online brokerage provides a large amount of reference content.&amp;nbsp; As this content is not specific to any user and is publicly available, it is not protected by SSL for performance reasons like the trading interface is.&amp;nbsp; The site is&amp;nbsp;correctly configured to restrict authentication cookies to SSL only, so they're only sent with requests protected by SSL.&amp;nbsp; An attacker positions themself on the same network segment as a user (someone using the public network in an internet cafe) and sniffs the user's traffic, but because the cookies are only sent via SSL, they cannot retrieve them.</p>
