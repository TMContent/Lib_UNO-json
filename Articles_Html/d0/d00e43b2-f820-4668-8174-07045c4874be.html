<h1>Applies To</h1><p>Any application that uses credentials.
</p><h1>Description</h1><p>A dictionary attack is a technique to defeat weak authentication credentials using a pre-compiled list of common usernames and passwords. It relies on the fact that users tend to use weak passwords that can be easily remembered. Though similar to a brute-force attack, this technique is faster as it exhausts only the common possibilities. The input-set in a dictionary attack is limited to words that could be derived from a dictionary, hence the name of the attack.
</p><p>
If the attacker has a lot of time available and the application does not deny repeated login attempts after a threshold number of attempts, the attacker may script login attempts using large lists of usernames and passwords. Username lists and common password lists are freely available from many websites.
</p><h1>Impact</h1><ul><li>Credential compromise.</li>
</ul><h1>Vulnerabilities</h1><ul><li>Weak password policy.</li>
</ul><h1>Countermeasures</h1><ul><li>Enforce strong passwords: Applications should enforce strong passwords that require users to construct their passwords using a larger input-set. </li>
<li>An example of strong password requirements is:<ul>
<li>At least 8 characters long.</li>
<li>Contains lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
<li>The password is regularly changed by the user, such as once every 3 months.</li></ul></li>
