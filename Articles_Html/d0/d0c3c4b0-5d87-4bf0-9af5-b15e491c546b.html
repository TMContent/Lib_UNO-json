</ul><h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that logging is centralized.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>A centralized logging subsystem is simpler to maintain and implement correctly.
</p><h2>How to Check</h2><p>Use the following steps to verify that logging is centralized:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify the logging subsystem.</strong> The logging subsystem should provide an API that allows generating log entries from application code. Make a list of functions that may be used to generate log entries.</li>
<li> <strong>Examine log entries. Find out where log entries are stored and examine them. This should give you clues about the functionality of the logging subsystem.</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Review code.</strong> Find code that generates log entries. Make sure this code uses the centralized logging subsystem.</li>
</ol><h2>How to Fix</h2><p>Perform the following actions to centralize logging: 
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify existing logging functionality.</strong> Examine the application architecture to identify logging facilities, such as the logging API and where audit trails are actually stored. Make a list of APIs used to log events, document how to use them, and where they store logs.</li>
<li> <strong>Design the logging subsystem.</strong> Design and implement a class or library specifically for logging. When designing the logging subsystem, consider sending logs to a remote log server. Consider the following factors when designing the logging subsystem:<ol>
<li> Log throttling</li>
<li> Logging important event details for both successful and failed operations</li>
<li> Logging important security operations</li>
<li> Logging important business operations</li>
<li> Monitoring the use of privileged accounts</li>
<li> Logging user management events</li>
<li> Avoiding including sensitive information in logs</li>
<li> Logging unusual activity</li>
<li> Sending logs to a centralized server</li></ol></li>
<li> <strong>Implement the logging subsystem.</strong> Write code that generates log entries according to your design. </li>
<li> <strong>Use the logging subsystem.</strong> Use the logging class or library whenever logs are generated. If earlier code exists that generates log entries, replace it with calls to the new logging subsystem API.</li>
