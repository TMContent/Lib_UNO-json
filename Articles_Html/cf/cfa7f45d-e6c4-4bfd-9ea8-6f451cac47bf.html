<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 6.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not use production data for testing or development.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>There may be vulnerabilities in the testing and development environments that may cause unauthorized disclosure. The access controls in the testing and development environments are often not as strict as in the production environment, so using live PANs
 may lead to unauthorized disclosure. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the information security policy to not use live PANs or other production data for testing or development. Instruct the responsible staff members to not use live PANs or other production data for testing or development.</p>
