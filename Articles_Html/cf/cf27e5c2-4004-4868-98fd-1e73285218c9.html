  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>A wireless IDS/IPS should be deployed or a wireless analyzer used at least once every quarter to detect unauthorized devices.&nbsp;The wireless IDS/IPS solution should identify all wireless devices in use and generate alerts when unauthorized devices or attacks
 are detected. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A wireless IDS or IPS can detect unauthorized wireless devices. Detecting such devices clearly indicate the presence of an attack.
</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Interview the responsible personnel to identify the location of the IDS/IPS and ask them to demonstrate the administration interface. Verify that the IDS/IPS is set up to notify staff if an unauthorized wireless device is detected.
</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Choose a wireless IDS or IPS solution. Configure the wireless IDS or IPS by following the vendor's instructions. Set the IDS or IPS to alert the staff in the event of a suspected compromise.
