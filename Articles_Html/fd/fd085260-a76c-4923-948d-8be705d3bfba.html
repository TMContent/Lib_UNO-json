  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Consider using Transport security when possible.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>By using Transport security you can have better perfomance than&nbsp;Message security. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>When you want to support point-point communication and you don't want to support intermediary scenarios or protocol transition.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Transport security secures the client-server communication channel using HTTPS and Transport Layer Security (TLS) over TCP. Transport Security is transport dependent and does not require that the communicating parties understand XML-level security concepts. This can improve the interoperability.</p>
  <p>Consider that, if you are using transport security you cannot use Service Credential Negotiation or authentication types such as Username or Issue Token (CardSpace).</p>
  <p>Use the following criteria to decide whether or not to use transport security:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Point-to-point. Transport security supports point-to-point communication and does not support intermediary scenarios or protocol transition.
</li>
    <li>Streaming. Transport security can support streaming data scenarios.
</li>
    <li>Binding limitations. Transport security does not work with the wsDualHttpBinding.
</li>
    <li>Authentication limitations. Transport security does not work with negotiation, username, Issue Token (CardSpace)&nbsp; or Kerberos direct authentication<br /></li>
  </ul>
