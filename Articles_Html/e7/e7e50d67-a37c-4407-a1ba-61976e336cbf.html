  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Accounts that have been inactive for 90 days and accounts of recently terminated employees should be removed or disabled.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Accounts that are not actively used should be disabled to assure that attackers are not using them.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Unfortunately, Windows Server cannot show a list of inactive user accounts in its default configuration. A list of idle users can be retrieved using a simple PowerShell script. PowerShell is installed by default on Windows 2008 but has to be downloaded and
 installed on the earlier versions of the Windows Server Operating System. Download the script from the link at the bottom of this page and execute it to see a list of users that have been inactive for 90 days or more.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>If necessary, download and install PowerShell. Download the PowerShell script from the link at the bottom of this page. Uncomment the last line of the script to make the script disable the inactive accounts. Schedule the script to run automatically every
 day.</p>
