<p>##What to Do##</p>
<p>Examine trust boundaries, data flow, and entry/exit points to identify attack vectors that exist for your application. Use a security framework to list and classify identified attack vectors.</p>
<p>##Why##</p>
<p>As part of the AWS shared security model, you must address security functions in order to manage, monitor, alert, audit and respond to incidents. To effectively carry out these responsibilities you must identify attack vectors by using your security framework.</p>
<p>In the cloud your responsibility is to securely manage running OS instances and applications, and protect data stores. As part of your security posture, maintain on-going awareness of info-sec, vulnerabilities, and threats.</p>
<p>##When##</p>
<p>When running an application in the cloud, you must secure the application. A variety of infrastructure safeguards are provided by AWS. You must always provide additional protection, especially when your application works with sensitive information.</p>
<p>##How##</p>
<p>The following steps will guide you in identifying attack vectors for your applications in the cloud.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the assets.</strong> In the cloud, you will need to list the assets you are trying to protect. AWS Config is a service feature that can inventory your resources for the purpose of identifying attack vectors. After enabling AWS Config through the management panel, export the resource inventory. Review the configuration details so that you can evaluate the value of individual resources. Configuration changes can be tracked, so that you can reliably audit resources throughout deployment lifecycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess the value of assets.</strong> Review the list of resources, and consider the value of your assets to attackers. It is difficult to assign a monetary value to a cloud application, since development, deployment and ongoing costs are associated with different cost models. Examine the cloud resources you have identified, and evaluate the cost of losing sensitive data, for example. An application which processes sensitive data has a very high target value, since it may be processing and storing many pieces of protected personal information. As an example, if consumer data is lost, there will be a large cost to the organization as it reacts with free credit reports for individuals who have personally identifiable information (PII) compromised. In most cases, using a simple scale for assessing value will be sufficient. Assess the value as high (catastrophic loss with potential to end the business), medium (significant loss and costs which the business can cover), or low (possible monetary costs with quick resolution possible).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider resources of attackers.</strong> Consider the resources available to potential attackers. Understand the current threat landscape, and make an appraisal of how many threat vectors can be launched per period. Where your application is using public connections, they are protected by AWS infrastructure. At the application layer you may be processing and storing sensitive information, and this has high value to potential intruders and attracts the attention of large groups with extensive resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analyze the attack vectors.</strong> Consider the possible approaches that attackers might use to compromise your assets. Identify attack vectors for your application by reviewing the vulnerabilities, and determining how the attacker will exploit them. This information will, of course, help you to revise your design approach, but more effort is required to better understand how the attackers will use social engineering and command and control (C2) methods against your application. If you allow mobile device connections, there is a substantial increase of attack vectors as you consider each mobile OS you support. No doubt you should also consider attack vectors from your cloud connections as well as your business partners. Although the probability is low for attack vectors from the infrastructure, it is better to use the credo, &quot;nothing is impossible.&quot; Social engineering, insider attack, and facility security cannot be eliminated 100%. Rogue employees have been known to walk away with valuable information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design countermeasures.</strong> After you have put together a list of attack vectors, design effective countermeasures. For example, your application already filters user input in order to thwart cross site scripting (XSS) threats. However, when your application is ported to new mobile OS versions, can new weakness develop? How will you apply new controls effectively for this example? By applying defense-in-depth security principles, you can identify gaps that may exist in the security controls of your application, and bring focus to the need for additional countermeasures. The resources applied to designing countermeasures will be determined by the risk level, which is derived from potential losses and likelihood of occurrence.</p>
