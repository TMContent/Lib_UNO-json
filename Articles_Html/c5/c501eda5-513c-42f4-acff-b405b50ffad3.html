  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>If you turn&nbsp;off Mutual Authentication, be aware of service spoofing.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>This allows&nbsp;the calls to your service may be diverted to a malicious service through DNS poisoning or a man in the middle attack.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Be aware that your service may be spoofed by a malicious attacker if you are running your service in a scenario in which mutual authentication has been turned off. Without mutual authentication, calls to your service may be diverted to a malicious service through DNS poisoning or a man in the middle attack.</p>
  <p>The follow scenarios will result in mutual authentication being turned off:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you turn off message and transport security on your binding
<li>If you use basicHttpBinding which has message and transport security turned off by default
<li>If you use NTLM authentication</li></li></li>
  </ul>
