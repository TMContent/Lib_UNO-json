  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Keep logs generated by anti-virus software for a year or more.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Keeping anti-virus logs helps investigate security incidents. One of the biggest questions that may be answered by reviewing anti-virus logs is whether the compromise was due to a non-specific automated threat or due to a targeted attack.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that the anti-virus keeps logs in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable logging.</strong> Locate the anti-virus administration interface. Some anti-virus packages have a control panel on the systems where they are deployed and some anti-virus suites offer a centralized control panel. The number of options offered
 by the anti-virus interface is usually small enough that a person with an IT background can figure out what all of them are and how to use them. The administration interface should offer an option to maintain anti-virus logs. If this option is not available,
 please consider installing and configuring a different anti-virus. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure the anti-virus to retain logs for a year or more.</strong> If the software does not support storing logs for a year, configure it to store logs for at least three months. If the software does not allow storing the logs for at least three
 months, please consider installing and configuring a different anti-virus. If the anti-virus supports storing logs for at least three months, but not for a year, implement backup procedures to keep the anti-virus logs for at least a year.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Integrate the anti-virus with the centralized log server. </strong>Ideally, the anti-virus should be integrated with the centralized log server, and the log server should keep the logs for at least a year. Ask the anti-virus vendor about integration
 with your log server. Configure the anti-virus to send logs to the centralized log server by following the vendor's instructions. Consider using a different anti-virus if yours is not compatible with your log server.</p>
