<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use file authorization when using windows authentication. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using file authorization with Windows authentication allows you to leverage groups and roles defined in your company's Active Directory to control per-file authorization inside your application.&amp;nbsp; While not necessarily sufficient for all of your authorization needs, it can be a very powerful tool. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All applications which use Windows authentication should use file authorization as part of their authorization toolkit. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>File authorization works automatically when using Windows authentication, and there is no need to impersonate the original user.&amp;nbsp; The <b>FileAuthorizationModule</b> only performs access checks against the requested file.&amp;nbsp; For example, if you request Default.aspx and it contains an embedded user control (Usercontrol.ascx), which in turn includes an image tag (pointing to Image.gif), the <b>FileAuthorizationModule</b> performs an access check for Default.aspx and Usercontrol.ascx, because these file types are mapped by IIS to the ASP.NET ISAPI extension.&amp;nbsp; The <b>FileAuthorizationModule</b> does not perform a check for Image.gif, because this is a static file handled internally by IIS.&amp;nbsp; However, because access checks for static files are performed by IIS, the authenticated user must still be granted read permission to the file with an appropriately configured ACL. </p>
