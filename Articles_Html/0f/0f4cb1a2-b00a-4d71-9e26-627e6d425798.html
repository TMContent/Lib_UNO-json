<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Use prepared statements to execute SQL queries, especially when untrusted data is being passed to the database. Do not concatenate user input into SQL queries. You can use static query strings without using prepared statements and it won't result in SQL injection, so long as all queries that include untrusted data, such as user input, use prepared statements. You can also use parameterized stored procedures as an alternative solution to similar effect.</p>
<p>Prepared statements mitigate the number one risk for Internet-facing Web applications that use databases: SQL injection. This powerful attack is language independent, as it depends on the algorithm used to generate SQL strings passed to the database and affects the database engine, not the actual application. The vulnerability is caused by concatenating untrusted data into SQL query strings. This allows attackers to insert valid SQL statement fragments as part of user input so they, in turn, are embedded within the SQL query that is submitted to the database engine for execution. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially compromise the entire database and often the application. Compromising the application can then potentially be leveraged to take over the server and then use it to pivot around whatever networks it might be connected to.</p>
<p>Prepared statements offer a simple yet effective mitigation since they automatically separate user input from SQL syntax, making it impossible to modify the structure of the SQL query, regardless of what data is entered by the user.</p>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>Here is a classic SQL injection example:</p>
<pre><code>	&lt;?php
	$username = 'root';
	$password = '';
	$con = mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, $username, $password, &quot;tpcatalog&quot;);

	if(mysqli_connect_errno())
	{
	echo &quot;Error: could not connect to the database&quot;;
	}

	//VULNERABLE CODE BELOW
	$query = &quot;SELECT name, description FROM TPCourses WHERE id=&quot;.$_REQUEST['id'];
	$result = $con-&gt;query($query);
	//VULNERABLE CODE ABOVE

	if($result-&gt;num_rows &gt;0){
	while($row = $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()){
	echo $row['name'] . ' ' . $row['description'] . '&lt;br&gt;';
	}

	$con-&gt;close();
	}
</code></pre>
<p>Concatenating untrusted data to the end of an SQL query is probably the most common type of SQL injection. It is so common that some attackers use search engines to look for URLs that contain an id parameter, because a lot of such pages are vulnerable.</p>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>Let's fix the vulnerable code from the example above using prepared statements:</p>
<pre><code>	&lt;?php
	$username = 'root';
	$password = '';
	$con = new mysqli(&quot;localhost&quot;, $username, $password, &quot;tpcatalog&quot;);

	if(mysqli_connect_errno())
	{
	echo &quot;Error: could not connect to the database&quot;;
	}

	//INVULNERABLE CODE BELOW
	$query = $con-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT name, description FROM TPCourses WHERE id=(?)&quot;);
	$query-&gt;bind_param(&quot;i&quot;, intval($_REQUEST['id']));
	$query-&gt;execute();
	$query-&gt;bind_result($name, $description);
	//INVULNERABLE CODE ABOVE

	while($query-&gt;fetch()){
	echo $name . ' ' . $description . '&lt;br&gt;';
	}

	$query-&gt;close();
	$con-&gt;close();
</code></pre>
<p>There is no error checking or handling in the solution example to make it simpler and easier to read, but you should always do error checking and handling on production systems. A database connection might fail for example. The solution example does not contain an SQL injection vulnerability, even though it passes untrusted input to the database without validation, encoding, escaping or sanitization. In practice, all untrusted input should be validated.</p>
