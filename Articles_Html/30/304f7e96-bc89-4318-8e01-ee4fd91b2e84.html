<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not store cardholder PIN information.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The cardholder PIN is used for authentication at ATMs and that makes it of high value to an attacker. In the rare event it is required for a transaction, it should not be stored after the transaction has been processed.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Identify the storage mechanism that stores the PIN, for example a script or a database query. Change the storage mechanism so that it does not record the PIN.</p>
