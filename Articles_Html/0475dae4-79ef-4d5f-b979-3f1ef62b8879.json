      "Check if security architecture and design reviews have been conducted.",
      "If you spend time and effort at the beginning of your project to analyze and review your application architecture and design, you can eliminate design-related vulnerabilities and improve your application’s overall security. It is much easier and less expensive to fix vulnerabilities at design time than it is later in the development cycle when substantial re-engineering might be required. Use the architecture and design review as a checkpoint to ensure compliance with your team’s design guidelines. The review should cover both deployment and design considerations. By considering your design in relation to the target deployment environment and the security policies defined by that environment, you can help to ensure a smoother and more secure application deployment. Perform architecture and design reviews iteratively as your design evolves or as you learn more about the design and architecture of your applications. If your application has already been created, the architecture and design review is still an important part of the security assessment process that can help you to fix vulnerabilities and improve future designs.",
