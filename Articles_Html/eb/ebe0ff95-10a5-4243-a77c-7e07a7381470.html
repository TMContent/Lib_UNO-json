<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <p>Scala and Play Framework 2.1.0+<br /></p>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure all test accounts have been removed.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Test accounts provide access to the application's functionality during 
development. Since they are often poorly secured, they are a common 
target for attackers. Removing them before deployment is the 
best&nbsp;option.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to ensure that your application has all of its test accounts removed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check if your application has existing test users.&nbsp;</strong>Enumerate all of your application's users. Verify that there are no test accounts in your application's user database. A common list of test accounts includes, but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any account containing your application's name and a number</li>
        <li>Any account containing the word "test" and a number</li>
        <li>Any account that has been identified in your application's documentation as being a test account</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check if your application has hard-coded users.&nbsp;</strong>Verify that your application's code base does not contain any hard-coded users. A hard-coded user is a sequence of a&nbsp;username and password that is initialized to a value at the time when your application starts. Example:</p>
      <pre>String user = "test002";<br />String pass = "pass"</pre>Common locations to look for hard-coded users include:<ul><li>Authentication procedures</li><li>Authorization procedures</li><li>Procedures that involve change of privileges</li><li>Components that require access controls</li></ul></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check if your application has existing test roles.&nbsp;</strong>Verify that there are no existing test roles left in your application. Common test roles include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any role containing the word "test"</li>
        <li>Any role that is identified as a test role in your application's documentation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check if your application has special privileges for test roles.&nbsp;</strong>Verify that there are no conditions throughout your application's code base that grant test roles special permissions, such as:</p>
      <pre> {<br />       // The application provides a side door allowing users in the testRole<br />       // role to execute functionality that is entitled only to users in the<br />       // Manager role<br />       if (req.isUserInRole("Manager") || req.isUserInRole("testRole"))<br />       {<br />            ...<br />       }<br />       else<br />       {<br />            ...<br />       }<br /> }</pre>Common locations to look for special privileges to test roles include:<ul><li>Authorization procedures</li><li>Procedures that involve change of privileges</li><li>Components that require access controls</li></ul></li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>Use the following steps when removing test accounts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate all accounts.&nbsp;</strong>List all the users&nbsp;of your application. This should be a comprehensive list that includes, but is not limited to, active users, inactive users, users pending confirmation and test accounts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the use of each account.&nbsp;</strong>Examine the use/status of each account. Sort the accounts into groups according to their use/status.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove the accounts that will no longer be used.&nbsp;</strong>Once the accounts are sorted into groups, list all accounts that are used for test purposes. After identifying all test accounts, remove them from your application's database.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce strong passwords on the remaining accounts.&nbsp;</strong>After removing all test accounts, enforce strong passwords for the remaining accounts in your application. Strong passwords decrease the probability of compromising valid users. Consult the&nbsp;<a href="6d74a22d-31d2-4584-9d93-85687ea4a637">Enforce Strong Passwords</a>&nbsp;guideline.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;PCI DSS requirements state that passwords should be at least seven characters in length, use both letters and numbers, expire after no more than 90 days and that a user's new password should not be the same as the previous four.</p>
