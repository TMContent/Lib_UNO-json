  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use a least-privileged account to host your WCF service.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>This will reduce your application&#8217;s attack surface and reduce the potential damage if you are attacked.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If the service account requires additional access rights on infrastructure resources such as MSMQ, the event log, performance counters, and the file Ssstem, appropriate permissions should be given to these resources so that the WCF service can run successfully. If your service needs to access specific resources on behalf of the original caller, use impersonation and delegation to flow the caller&#8217;s identity for a downstream authorization check.</p>
  <p>In a development scenario, use the local network service account, which is a special built-in account that has reduced privileges. In a production scenario, create a least-privileged custom domain service account. </p>
