  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use object-oriented operators new and delete instead of direct memory operations, such as malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>One advantage of using object-oriented operators instead of direct memory operations is that new and delete operators automatically call constructors and destructors - this significantly reduces the likelihood of a number of typical programming errors. Calling constructors automatically removes the possibility of accessing memory of an object before it is initialized.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use new and delete operators whenever initiating objects based on classes.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>New and delete operators are very basic operators in C&#43;&#43; programming.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>To use the new operator:</strong> declare a class, declare a variable of that class type, and initialize the variable by calling the new operator. Arguments to the new operator are passed as arguments to the constructor.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>To use the delete operator:</strong> call the delete operator on a previously declared and initialized pointer of a non-system class type. Memory allocation and deallocation of basic system types, such as int, double, char, etc. are handled automatically.</p>
