<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PHP</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that PHP is configured to disable loading of scripts from URLs.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Preventing PHP from loading scripts from other web sites helps prevent remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Examine the <em>php.ini</em> file to make sure the <em>allow_url_include</em> is configured to "<em>Off</em>", like so:</p>
  <pre>allow_url_include = Off</pre>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the <em>allow_url_include</em> directive in <em>php.ini</em> to disable loading external scripts, like so:</p>
  <pre>allow_url_include = Off</pre>
  <p />If you application does not need to open URLs as files, it may be prudent to disable that functionality as well by using the <em>allow_url_fopen</em> directive in <em>php.ini</em>, like so:<pre>allow_url_fopen = Off</pre><h1>Related Items</h1><ul><li><a href="/article/f54eacd2-ec2f-47a8-9639-67c01a1fcdd0">Disable Loading Files from URLs</a></li></ul>
