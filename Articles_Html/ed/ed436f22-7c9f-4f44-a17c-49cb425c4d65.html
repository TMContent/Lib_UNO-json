<h1>Description</h1><p>Most web applications use cookies to keep track of session state. Some applications use other mechanisms to keep track of authenticated sessions. These custom authentication schemes are usually vulnerable to session hijacking. An attacker exploiting cookieless authentication schemes may gain elevated privileges by tampering with user-mutable parameters, or may hijack an authenticated session by intercepting it using some form of a man-in-the-middle attack. 
</p><h1>Impact</h1><p>Using cookieless authentication often allows an attacker to hijack user sessions. Once the attacker has hijacked a user's session, he can do anything that the user is allowed to do by the application. This usually allows the attacker to access and modify the user's data. If the attacker hijacks an administrator's session, he may be able to take full control of the application.
</p><h1>Countermeasures</h1><p>To prevent this problem, use platform-provided session management, use TLS to protect authentication, set HTTP-Only and Secure flags on session cookies, and send session cookies only over TLS. 
</p><p>
Use platform-provided session management:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="96059535-1543-458e-afb7-e40360b9dcd2">Use ASP.NET Session Management</a></li>
</ul><p>
Use TLS for authentication:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000960e37">Use TLS to Communicate Authentication Credentials</a></li>
</ul><p>
Set HTTP-Only and Secure flags on session cookies:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000894eab">Set HTTP-Only and Secure Flags on Session Cookies</a></li>
</ul><p>
Send session cookies only over TLS:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000737bd8">Send Session Cookies Only Using TLS</a></li>
</ul><h1>Application Check</h1><p>To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, ensure that platform-provided session management is used, TLS is used for authentication, HTTP-Only and Secure flags are set on session cookies, and session cookies are sent only over TLS.
</p><p>
Platform-provided session management is used:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="505042f3-ae71-4a3a-bf71-03fa1dbe34a7">ASP.NET Session Management Is Used</a></li>
</ul><p>
TLS is used for authentication:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008f91de">TLS Is Used to Communicate Authentication Credentials</a></li>
</ul><p>
HTTP-Only and Secure flags are set on session cookies:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000570fbb">HTTP-Only and Secure Flags Are Set on Session Cookies</a></li>
</ul><p>
Session cookies are sent only over TLS:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000071f956">Session Cookies Are Sent Only over TLS</a></li>
