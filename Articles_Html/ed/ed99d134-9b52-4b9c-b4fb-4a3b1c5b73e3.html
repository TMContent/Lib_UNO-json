<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>If you do not use delay-signing, use password-protected .pfx files to help protect your private key. Visual Studio&nbsp;includes support for .pfx files, which makes this very convenient. This approach is more appropriate for small- to medium-sized projects. If you previously shared or had access to .snk files that included a private key, you should use .pfx files instead (unless you use delay signing). </p>
