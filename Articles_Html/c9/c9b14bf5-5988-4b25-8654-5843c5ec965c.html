  <p>A dictionary attack is a cryptographic attack where an attacker attempts to defeat cryptographic ciphers by trying numerous decryption keys or passphrases from a dictionary.<span></span>Dictionaries are a list of possible keys and words to be tried while attempting to defeat the cryptographic cipher.<span></span><span></span>Dictionary attacks are also applicable to applications that use credentials to log in their clients. <span></span>The attack is similar to the cryptanalytic attack with the difference that credential dictionary attacks focus at finding a valid password to bypass authentication, so dictionaries consist of possible password values instead of key or passphrase values.</p>

  <p>First, it is necessary to understand the different attack scenarios involved:</p>

      <em>Cryptographic Dictionary Attack</em>
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>In contrast to brute-force attacks, in which numerous keys and passphrases are created systematically by performing an exhaustive search over the possible key space, dictionary attacks only try the possibilities supplied by the dictionary.<span></span>Thus, the attack always starts with the attacker building the dictionary list or file that will be used to defeat the cryptographic system.<span></span>The attacker then finds a ciphertext to decrypt into a known (in case of known-plaintext attacks) or an unknown plaintext (in case of ciphertext-only attacks).<span></span>The attack continues with the attacker passing each of the keys in the attack dictionary to the decryption function in order to find a valid decryption key.</p>
  <p>In detail:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The attacker builds an attack dictionary consisting of a list of possible keys/passphrases to use while trying to defeat the cryptographic system.</li>
    <li>The attacker finds a ciphertext to decipher.<span>&nbsp; </span></li>
    <li>The attacker iterates through the attack dictionary trying to decrypt the ciphertext with each of the dictionary entries.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
    <span>
      <em>Credentials Dictionary Attack</em>
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>The credentials dictionary attack scenario is similar to the previous one with the difference that the attacker is trying to circumvent authentication instead of trying to break cryptography.<span></span>Thus, the attacker’s goal is to find valid credentials like a valid password instead of finding a decryption key.<span></span>The attack starts with the attacker selecting a valid username for the target user.<span></span>Valid usernames can be leveraged using registration pages or by social engineering.<span></span>Then the attack follows a similar flow of the previous scenario.<span></span>The attacker builds of a dictionary containing a list of possible passwords.<span></span>A resourceful attacker would also mutate the dictionary by substituting letters<span></span>by numbers or applying similar mutations.<span></span>Then the attacker locates the authentication request such as one made by a log in web page.<span></span>The attack continues with the attacker passing each of the passwords in the dictionary to the log in procedure in order to find a password that works and enables the attacker to log in to the target application.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p>In detail:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The attacker selects the target client to attack and discovers the target’s username.</li>
    <li>The attacker constructs the attack dictionary consisting of possible password values.</li>
    <li>The attacker iterates through the attack dictionary trying to log in to the application with each of the dictionary entries.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
    <span>
      <em>Encrypted Password Cracking</em>
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>Sometimes the attacker’s goal is not to recover a valid key or password but an encrypted/hashed version of the target password.<span></span>This scenario is common when attackers have access to a password file containing a set of password hashes like the UNIX password file in which passwords appear as DES hashes or when sniffing a network connection shows passwords being transferred after they have been hashed/encrypted.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In detail:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The attacker gains access to a password file or a network capture showing a hashed or encrypted version of the target password and the cryptographic algorithm used to hash/encrypt the value.</li>
    <li>The attacker constructs the attack dictionary consisting of possible password values.</li>
    <li>For each entry in the attack dictionary the attacker:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>hashes or encrypts the entry using the algorithm discovered in step 2.</li>
      <li>compares the hashed/encrypted password with the target password from step 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>
    <span>Step 2: Analyze Causes and Countermeasures</span>
  </h1>
  <p>Next, it is necessary to understand what causes dictionary attacks and how to countermeasure them.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
  <h2>
    <span>
      <em>Attack causes</em>
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>Cryptographic dictionary attacks exist by design.<span></span>This issue cannot be identified in code since it’s an attack method rather than an implementation flaw.<span>&nbsp; </span>In most cases attackers will have access to the decryption function as well as the ciphertext.<span></span>These are the only two requirements to start a dictionary attack and, since developers are encouraged to use a public cryptographic algorithm instead of implementing their own, this attack is innate in cryptographic applications which follow security best practices.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>
    <span>
      <em>Attack countermeasures</em>
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>For cryptanalytic dictionary attacks that target recovering a key rather than a password, choosing a large enough key reduces the likelihood of the decryption key being found by a dictionary attack.<span></span>Applications that implement cryptography use keys of a certain length (measured in bits) that determines the possible keys combinations -or key space.<span></span>For instance, a 64-bit key has 2^64possible key combinations.<span></span>The larger the decryption key the more difficult to construct a dictionary that includes it.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p>To protect against dictionary attacks on passwords, or similar variations such as attacks through OS password files, it is recommended to avoid using words available in dictionaries or common variation of dictionary words or names such as “h0us3” for “house” or “3ric” for “Eric”.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applications must enforce a strong-password policy with complexity requirements that limit the chances of passwords existing in attack dictionaries. Additional ways to countermeasure <i>credential</i> dictionary attacks such as using locking down accounts, introducing time delays to the log in process, asking for human interaction proofs such as CAPTCHAs or secret questions, or executing different behaviors after a number of failed attempts.<span></span>Note that these countermeasures are only applicable to credential dictionary attacks and not for cryptographic attacks.<span></span><br /></p>

    <span>Conclusions</span>
  </h1>
  <p>Dictionary attacks focus at discovering a valid key from a predetermined list of possible keys.<span></span>The attack is trivial is it only requires the attacker to discover the encryption algorithm in place and a ciphertext and iterate through the key dictionary trying to produce a readable plaintext from each of the possible keys.<span></span>In the credentials scenario, the attack is similar but instead of trying to defeat a cryptographic procedure it aims at circumventing authentication by trying a dictionary of possible password values.<span></span>Even though this attack is innate to cryptographic systems and authentication procedures, methods to countermeasure this attack include using a large enough key and an industry standard algorithm such as AES, a strong password, account lockout policies, time delays, or human interaction proofs.<span></span>Testing varies depending on whether a plaintext is known or not and on the type of target system (cryptographic vs. credentials).</p>
