<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.3.8.a</li>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.3.8.b</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use only RFC 1918 addresses for internal interfaces on devices on the company network. Ensure that internal IP addresses are hidden from the Internet by using Network Address Translation (NAT).</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Leaking IP addresses from the local network to the Internet may provide information to potential attackers that could help them carry out an attack.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Assign RFC 1918 IP addresses to all network devices on all internal networks. Configure the Internet firewall or router to use NAT for Internet access to the DMZ. Configure port forwarding on the Internet firewall or router to handle incoming connections
 from the Internet. Computers in the cardholder data segment should not have Internet access.</p>
