<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Ensure that you perform access control checks related to your business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that you apply to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example,
 a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor.</p>
