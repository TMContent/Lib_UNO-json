      "Buffer overflows occur when code can be manipulated to cause the application to write data beyond the limits of memory allocated for that data. In short, a buffer overflow happens when the application tries to write too much data into too little (memory) space.",
      "There are two types of buffer overflows: stack buffer overflows and heap buffer overflows. Stack buffer overflows are much easier to exploit, because the stack stores instruction pointers in addition to data buffers. By overwriting the instruction pointers in the stack, the attacker can redirect the applicationâ€™s execution flow to data that he has placed somewhere in memory, thus allowing him to execute arbitrary code. The amount of code that can be executed is limited to the amount of data that can be placed by the attacker in memory. The stack buffer overflow is the \"classic\" buffer overflow that people usually refer to when they talk about buffer overflows.",
      "In contrast, heap buffer overflows are much harder to exploit, and they are thus less frequent and less well-known. The heap does not usually store instruction pointers, at least not in the same consistent manner that the stack does, which is why they are harder to exploit. To exploit a heap-based buffer overflow, the attacker tries to corrupt memory structures stored in the heap in an attempt to overwrite a function pointer to point to code that he has placed as data in memory. The idea is that when the application calls the function whose pointer has been overwritten, the attacker's code will be executed instead. The result of heap-based buffer overflows is also arbitrary code execution.",

  "html": "<h1>Description</h1><p>Buffer overflows occur when code can be manipulated to cause the application to write data beyond the limits of memory allocated for that data. In short, a buffer overflow happens when the application tries to write too much data into too little (memory) space. \n</p><p>\nThere are two types of buffer overflows: stack buffer overflows and heap buffer overflows. Stack buffer overflows are much easier to exploit, because the stack stores instruction pointers in addition to data buffers. By overwriting the instruction pointers in the stack, the attacker can redirect the applicationâ€™s execution flow to data that he has placed somewhere in memory, thus allowing him to execute arbitrary code. The amount of code that can be executed is limited to the amount of data that can be placed by the attacker in memory. The stack buffer overflow is the \"classic\" buffer overflow that people usually refer to when they talk about buffer overflows. \n</p><p>\nIn contrast, heap buffer overflows are much harder to exploit, and they are thus less frequent and less well-known. The heap does not usually store instruction pointers, at least not in the same consistent manner that the stack does, which is why they are harder to exploit. To exploit a heap-based buffer overflow, the attacker tries to corrupt memory structures stored in the heap in an attempt to overwrite a function pointer to point to code that he has placed as data in memory. The idea is that when the application calls the function whose pointer has been overwritten, the attacker's code will be executed instead. The result of heap-based buffer overflows is also arbitrary code execution. \n</p><p>\nA failed attempt for either type of buffer overflow will usually result in the application crashing, thus producing a denial of service condition. \n</p><p>\nBuffer overflows affect applications using native code, especially applications written in C and C++.\n</p><h1>Impact</h1><p>Attackers usually seek to exploit buffer overflows in order to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the exploited application.
