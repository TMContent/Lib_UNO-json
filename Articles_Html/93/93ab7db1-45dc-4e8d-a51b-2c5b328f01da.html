  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 5.2.d </li>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 10.7</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check that the anti-virus software keeps logs. Verify that the anti-virus logs&amp;nbsp;are kept for at least one year. Ensure&amp;nbsp;that there are&amp;nbsp;processes in place to restore at least the last three months' logs for immediate review.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if the anti-virus keeps logs in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check that logging is enabled. </strong>Locate the anti-virus administration interface. Some anti-virus packages have a control panel on the systems where they are deployed and some anti-virus suites offer a centralized control panel. The number
 of options offered by the anti-virus interface is usually small enough that a person with an IT background can figure out what all of them are and how to use them in very short time.&amp;nbsp;The administration interface should offer an option to maintain anti-virus
 logs. Verify that this option is enabled. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check how long logs are kept. </strong>Check the anti-virus options to see how long the logs are kept. Ideally, the current log should be kept for at least a year by the anti-virus itself. If the anti-virus does not keep logs for at least a year,
 make sure there are procedures in places to keep the anti-virus logs for at least a year. If the anti-virus does not keep logs for at least three months, make sure there are processes to make at least the last three months' logs available for immediate review.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine&amp;nbsp;logs. </strong>Check the anti-virus logs to make sure they exist.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check centralized log server integration.</strong> Ideally, the anti-virus should be integrated with the centralized log server, and the log server should keep the logs for at least a year. Ask the anti-virus vendor about integration with your log
 server. Check the log server to see if it receives logs from the anti-virus.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that the anti-virus keeps logs in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable logging.</strong> Locate the anti-virus administration interface. Some anti-virus packages have a control panel on the systems where they are deployed and some anti-virus suites offer a centralized control panel. The number of options offered
 by the anti-virus interface is usually small enough that a person with an IT background can figure out what all of them are and how to use them. The administration interface should offer an option to maintain anti-virus logs. If this option is not available,
 please consider installing and configuring a different anti-virus. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure the anti-virus&amp;nbsp;to retain logs for a year or more.</strong> If the software does not support storing logs for a year, configure it to store logs for at least three months. If the software does not allow storing the logs for at least three
 months, please consider installing and configuring a different anti-virus. If the anti-virus supports storing logs for at least three months, but not for a year, implement backup procedures to keep the anti-virus logs for at least a year.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Integrate the anti-virus with the centralized log server. </strong>Ideally, the anti-virus should be integrated with the centralized log server, and the log server should keep the logs for at least a year. Ask the anti-virus vendor about integration
 with your log server. Configure the anti-virus to send logs to the centralized log server by following the vendor's instructions. Consider using a different anti-virus if yours is not compatible with your log server.</p>
