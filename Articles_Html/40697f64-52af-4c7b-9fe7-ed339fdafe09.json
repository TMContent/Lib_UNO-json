      "The adversary's ideal goal when attacking cryptographic systems is to recover the cryptographic key or to decipher specific encrypted information. In the ideal case, a remote adversary can only sniff the encrypted packets; they can';t manipulate either the text before encryption (plaintext) or the text after encryption (ciphertext). A chosen plaintext bug allows adversaries to choose any particular plaintext they want. The adversary tricks the victim in to encrypting their own plaintext (P) and gathers useful information from the resulting ciphertext (C).",
      "The following steps are recommended to test for chosen plaintext bugs:",
      "First, you need to understand the details of chosen plaintext attacks. The basic concept of a chosen plaintext attack is really simple: an attacker chooses plaintext to feed the encryption algorithm they want to break. There are two scenarios associated with this kind of bug:",
      "In the batched scenario, the attacker possesses all of the plaintext beforehand (prior to launching the attack and obtaining any ciphertext). The attacker then encrypts the plaintext with the encryption system in question, finally obtaining the corresponding ciphertext. This attack is commonly used in attempting to brute-force the private key of the encryption system.",
      "In an online chosen plaintext attack, the attacker starts by reading one or more plaintext blocks and their corresponding ciphertext. The attacker then generates new plaintext blocks based on information from previous sniffed packets. The attacker then forces the victim to encrypt the new plaintext blocks; and finally, the attacker reads the ciphertext produced by their chosen plaintext blocks. A common use of this attack is to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.",
