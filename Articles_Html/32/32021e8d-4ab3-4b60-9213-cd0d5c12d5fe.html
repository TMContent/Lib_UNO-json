<p>Code integrity is the process of ensuring your code’s quality and protecting it from potential attackers once it has been shipped. Using tools and processes that help obscure your code and protect it from potential reverse engineering can help keep users from gaining a low level view of the application’s inner workings. While security through obscurity is not a bulletproof way to prevent reverse engineering, it does provide an additional layer of protection once the code is out in the wild. View this room to learn the best ways integrity is kept in check once a final product is shipped.
