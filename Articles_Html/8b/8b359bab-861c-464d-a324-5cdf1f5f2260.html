<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft&#174; Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) 3.5 <li>Microsoft Visual Studio&#174; 2008</li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use temporary certificates only when you are developing and testing your WCF service. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Temporary certificates are less expensive than production certificates and are easier to create. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Consider using this guideline when&nbsp;using certificates.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Once you are ready to deploy, replace your temporary certificate with a production certificate provided by a certificate authority (CA). <br />Temporary certificates can be created by using the makecert utility. If you are deploying a WCF service for a real-world production environment, use a certificate provided by a CA such as Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Certificate Server or a third party.</p>
