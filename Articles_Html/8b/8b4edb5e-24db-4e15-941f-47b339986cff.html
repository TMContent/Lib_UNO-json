<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>The safe C Runtime (CRT) libraries are updated versions of the standard C and C&#43;&#43; libraries, including the CRT Library, Standard C&#43;&#43; Library (SCL), Active Template Library (ATL), and Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). The updates are designed to help protect applications compiled with Visual C&#43;&#43;. They add appropriate buffer checks to functions that are known to be vulnerable to attack; they validate parameters; and they deprecate other functions, such as <b>strcpy</b>, which are known to be vulnerable to attack. </p>
  <p>Use the secure version of a function if it exists. If a new secure function exists, the older, less secure version is marked as deprecated and the new version has the <b>_s</b> (secure) suffix. For example, use <b>strcpy_s</b> instead of <b>strcpy</b>. Note that the compiler will generate a warning if you use a deprecated function. </p>
