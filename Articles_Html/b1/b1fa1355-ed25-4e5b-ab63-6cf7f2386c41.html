  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Schedule periodic anti-virus scans.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Scanning for viruses regularly helps make sure that no known malware has compromised the cardholder data environment.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Verify that it is possible to run automatic scans with your anti-virus by referring to the vendor documentation or technical support. The documentation or technical support should provide the exact instructions on how to implement automatic scans. Automatic
 scans are a basic feature of modern anti-virus packages. If your anti-virus does not offer this feature, please consider installing and configuring a different anti-virus.</p>
