<p>Java has become one of the most widely used languages due to its “write once, run anywhere” philosophy. Because of its large install base, it has been widely targeted for attacks by both researchers and users actively looking to exploit vulnerabilities. View each topic below to better understand some of the most common exploits used against Java applications, and how to best combat each.

<li> <a href="2e03d087-3614-4927-8d20-d9efc3f7bbc4">Command Injection</a> - Applications often execute external commands as a part of their functionality. If the attacker is able to manipulate the choice of external commands or their parameters, the attacker may be able to use this functionality to execute arbitrary commands. If an attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands, he is typically able to take over the application and possibly take over the entire system.</li>
<li> <a href="f4f6aab8-f22e-4189-98bd-0a879cdedc40">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a> - A cross site request forgery (CSRF) attack occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into loading a page that contains a malicious request. This request may be able to change the state of the web application, and is possible because the request is sent in the context of the logged in victim. For many sites, each request automatically sends the victim's credentials, such as the session cookie or authentication credentials. Due to this fact, there is no way to distinguish the false request from a legitimate request. CSRF vulnerabilities affect web applications that allow authenticated users to perform operations that are not available to guest users.</li>
<li> <a href="e1066fc2-22e3-47b3-ac0d-34a6fa70da68">Cross-Site Scripting</a> - A web application's output is rendered as a web page. If user input is included in the web application output, then it is also rendered as a part of the web page. If user input is included in output without being validated and encoded, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability results. In that case, an attacker can modify the output web page to include malicious script, which is then executed by the browser that views the vulnerable page.</li>
<li> <a href="c92edd0d-f59a-4dd5-bed3-48a2190c895f">SQL Injection</a> - SQL injection is a type of vulnerability in database access code that allows attackers to execute unauthorized queries on the database. SQL injection typically occurs when an application uses input to construct dynamic SQL statements to access the database. SQL injection may also occur if stored procedures use dynamic queries that include untrusted input. Using the SQL injection attack, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the database with the privileges of the application.</li>
