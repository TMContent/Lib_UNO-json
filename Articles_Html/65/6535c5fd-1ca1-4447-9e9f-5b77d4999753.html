<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Set the &quot;Secure&quot; and &quot;HTTPOnly&quot; flags on all sensitive cookies.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Set the &quot;Secure&quot; flag on all sensitive cookies to protect the contents of the sensitive cookies from eavesdropping attacks. Setting the &quot;Secure&quot; flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured by TLS. The &quot;HTTPOnly&quot; flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script - this measure helps reduce the potential damage of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>To set the &quot;Secure&quot; and &quot;HTTPOnly&quot; flags on all sensitive cookies:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verify that TLS is available.</strong> The &quot;Secure&quot; flag forces cookies to be sent over TLS. TLS has to be available for this to work.</li>
<li><strong>Identify sensitive cookies.</strong> Session cookies should always be considered sensitive. Enumerate all cookies used by the application. Make a list of cookies that may contain sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Identify code that creates sensitive cookies.</strong> For each sensitive cookie in the list, find the code that creates that cookie.</li>
<li><strong>Set the &quot;Secure&quot; and &quot;HTTPOnly&quot; flags for each sensitive cookie.</strong> For each piece of code that creates a sensitive cookie, add code that sets the &quot;Secure&quot; and &quot;HTTPOnly&quot; flags for the cookie.</li>
</ol>
