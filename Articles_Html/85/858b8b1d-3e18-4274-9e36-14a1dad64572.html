<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PHP</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use existing libraries to generate keys, encrypt, and decrypt data. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using strong encryption algorithms helps prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>The typical scenario that requires web applications to use encryption is protecting stored sensitive data. Symmetric algorithms are the appropriate choice for this requirement. The industry standard for symmetric cryptography is AES with 256-bit key length. To use AES-256 in PHP:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use the PHP mcrypt extension.</strong> Compile PHP with mcrypt support or install PHP with mcrypt support built-in.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Write cryptographic utility functions that use AES-256.</strong> Write functions that generate keys, encrypt, and decrypt data. Please, see the link at the bottom of this article for a code example and detailed information about using AES-256 in PHP.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use the utility functions.</strong> Use the cryptographic utility functions whenever data needs to be encrypted or decrypted using symmetric cryptography.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
