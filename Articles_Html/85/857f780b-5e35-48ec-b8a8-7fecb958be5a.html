  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Consider using netTcpBinding when you migrate from DCOM.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>netTcpBinding uses binary encoding and TCP protocol, providing the best performance for .NET to .NET cross-machine communication.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If you are migrating from DCOM, consider netTcpBinding. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Consider the following when choosing netTcpBinding:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It supports transactions and reliable messaging. 
<li>It supports a wide range of authentication schemes. 
<li>If you use transport security mode, you can use windows and certificate authentication. 
<li>If you use message or mixed mode security, you can use windows, issue token, username and certificate authentication. 
<li>You can host in IIS 7.0 or a Windows Service. You can also host in IIS 6.0, but you must first have to activate the host W3wp process, before using the service.</li></li></li></li></li>
