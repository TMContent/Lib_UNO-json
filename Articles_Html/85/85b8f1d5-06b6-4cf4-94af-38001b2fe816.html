<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Protect authorization cookies from tampering and reading. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If a user can alter their authorization cookie, they can potentially alter the roles they are allowed to take in the system.&amp;nbsp; Reading an authorization cookie may allow a user to forge a working authorization cookie, again allowing them to gain more access to the system than they should have.&amp;nbsp; If cookies are encrypted and signed, and the signature and cookie contents checked for correctness and expiration every time they're used, both tampering and reading are prevented. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All systems which use authorization cookies should protect them against reading and modification. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>The following example shows a <b>&lt;roleManager&gt;</b> element configured to protect the authorization cookie. </p>
  <pre>&lt;roleManager enabled="true"<br />&amp;#9;cacheRolesInCookie="true"   <br />&amp;#9;cookieName=".ASPROLES"             <br />&amp;#9;cookieTimeout="30"             <br />&amp;#9;cookiePath="/"             <br />&amp;#9;cookieRequireSSL="true"             <br />&amp;#9;cookieSlidingExpiration="true"             <br />&amp;#9;cookieProtection="All"              <br />&amp;#9;createPersistentCookie="false"&gt;<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;</pre>
