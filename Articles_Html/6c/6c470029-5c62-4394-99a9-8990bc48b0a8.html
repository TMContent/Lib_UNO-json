  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To change session IDs during login:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify authentication functionality.</strong> Find the code that is responsible for authentication, including repeated authentication that is required for sensitive functionality.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Change session IDs during authentication.</strong> Add code that invalidates the current session ID and creates a new one. For example:</p>
        <pre>HttpSession session = request.getSession();<br />session.invalidate();<br />session = request.getSession(true);</pre>
      </li>
    </li>
