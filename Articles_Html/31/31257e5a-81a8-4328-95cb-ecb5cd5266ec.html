  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Protect off-site backups.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>An off-site back-up storage facility ensures that the back-ups will be available in the event the company experiences a fire or some other physical disaster. The back-up storage facility should be secure to ensure that back-ups are available in the event
 of a disaster and that the back-ups are not compromised.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Choose a secure off-site back-up storage facility. One example of such a facility is a bank. Place the back-ups in the secure off-site storage facility. Delegate responsibility for reviewing the back-up storage facility's security at least once a year. A
 back-up storage location may be considered secure if it has the same or greater level of security as your company.</p>
