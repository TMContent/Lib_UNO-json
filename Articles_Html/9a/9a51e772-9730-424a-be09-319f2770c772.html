<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that TLS is required for all private pages.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>TLS should be used to protect all pages that handle sensitive data, including all pages that use authentication or authorization features, to prevent unauthorized information disclosure.</p>
  <h1>How To Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that TLS is required for all private pages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive pages.</strong> Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive information, including all pages that use authentication or authorization features.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that a HTTPS binding exists.</strong>&nbsp;Start the "<em>Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</em>". Right-click on the site and select "<em>Edit bindings...</em>". Verify that a HTTPS binding exists. The HTTPS protocol should be bound to port 443.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Check that TLS is required for all sensitive pages.</strong>&nbsp;Start the "<em>Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</em>". Navigate the folders with the sensitive pages. Double-click on the SSL icon in the right pane and make sure that TLS is enabled for the folder. </p>
