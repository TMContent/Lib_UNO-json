<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Use the "double-submitted cookie" method as described by Felten and Zeller. This technique requires Javascript, so it may not work for browsers that have Javascript disabled.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Note that this can probably be bypassed using XSS (CWE-79).</p>
