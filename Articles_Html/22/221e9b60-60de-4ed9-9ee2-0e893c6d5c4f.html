<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Examples include the
<em>Safe C String Library</em> (<em>SafeStr</em>) by Messier and Viega, and the <em>
Strsafe.h</em> library from Microsoft. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.

    <strong>Note:</strong> This is not a complete solution, since many buffer overflows are not related to strings.</p>
