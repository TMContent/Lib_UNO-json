  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that Ingress and egress filtering is enabled so that incoming and outgoing packets with&nbsp;intrusion attempts are denied entry to the perimeter network.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Spoofed packets are representative of probes, attacks, and a knowledgeable attacker. Incoming packets with an internal address can indicate an intrusion attempt or probe and should be denied entry to the perimeter network. Likewise, set up your router to&nbsp;route outgoing packets only if they have a valid internal IP address. Verifying outgoing packets does not protect you from a denial of service attack, but it does keep such attacks from originating from your network.</p>
  <p>This type of filtering also enables the originator to be easily traced to its true source since the attacker would have to use a valid &#8212; and legitimately reachable &#8212; source address. </p>
