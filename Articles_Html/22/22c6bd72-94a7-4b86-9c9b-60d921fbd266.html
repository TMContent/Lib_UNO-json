  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that inactive sessions time-out.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Make sessions expire after a period of inactivity to make it harder for an attacker to hijack a session.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that inactive sessions time-out:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the time-out period.</strong>&nbsp;Examine project documentation to identify the required time-out period. If the inactive time-out period is configurable, find out the currently defined time-out period from the administrative interface.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Login to the application.</strong>&nbsp;Login to the application as a normal user.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that the session times out after a certain period.</strong>&nbsp;Wait for the duration of the defined time-out period. Verify that the session has timed out.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The reason for such a high-level approach is because there are multiple ways to make inactive sessions time-out and it would be difficult to look into all the locations seperately.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To make inactive sessions time-out:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify login functionality.</strong>&nbsp;Find code that handles user logins.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add code that sets the inactive session time-out period.</strong>&nbsp;There is no technical timeout for the Session. It expires when the user closes the web browser.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you need a functional timeout for a specific application, just store a timestamp into the user Session and use it however your application needs (e.g. for a maximum session duration, maxmimum inactivity duration, etc.). <a href="https://github.com/jroper/play-security-utils/">This</a> link explains how to add session timeout functionality to the application.&nbsp;</p>
