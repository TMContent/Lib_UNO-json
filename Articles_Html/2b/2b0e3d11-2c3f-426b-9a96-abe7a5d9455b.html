<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>When using a critical resource such as a configuration file, check to see if the resource has insecure permissions (such as being modifiable by any regular user), and generate an error or even exit the software if there is a possibility that the resource
 could have been modified by an unauthorized party.</p>
