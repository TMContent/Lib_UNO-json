<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure your application allows its users to verify the authenticity of your application.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Some applications are targets for phishing attacks. Failure to provide authentication of the application&nbsp;for the user allows attackers to spoof the application, therefore, fooling the users into submitting their credentials or other sensitive information into an attacker's malicious application.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to ensure the application is capable of proving its authenticity to its users:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that your application uses SSL to identify itself to the user. </strong>Check that your application's environment has enabled HTTPS. Verify that transactions of a sensitive nature are transmitted only over HTTPS connections. Check if the &lt;forms&gt; element in your application's <strong>web.config</strong> file has the <strong>requireSSL</strong> attribute set to "true" when performing form-based authentication:</p>
      <pre>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;forms loginUrl="login.aspx"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protection="All"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; timeout="20"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>requireSSL="true"</strong>&gt;&nbsp; <br />&lt;/forms&gt;<br />&lt;/authentication &gt;</pre>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check if your application displays a shared secret with its users. </strong>Check if your application has a personal shared secret for each of its users. Shared secrets include, but are not limited to, combinations of any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Layout</strong>: a user-defined layout/color scheme <li><strong>Picture</strong>: a user-defined image <li><strong>Word/Phrase</strong>: a user-defined word, phrase, or question</li></li></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verify that the shared secret is displayed to the user after providing their ID and before providing their credentials.</p>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>MyApp is a financial application with a public web interface. Because the application does not use SSL to certify its identity in front of the user, an attacker can set up a fake site and pretend to be MyApp. Because the user's browser has no mechanism of&nbsp;differentiating the real from the fake MyApp interface, it will not provide any warning signs to the user. Once a user accesses the fake MyApp interface,&nbsp;he may be fooled into providing&nbsp;his credentials to the attacker.</p>
