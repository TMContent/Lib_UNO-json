<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.2</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The card verification code (CVV2, CVC2, CID, CAV2) should not be stored under any circumstances.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The card verification code should not be stored in order to limit the potential damage in the event of a successful attack. The card verification code is often used for authentication in online transactions but does not need to be stored after the transaction
 has been processed.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the following to make sure they don't include the card verification code:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incoming transaction data </li>
    <li>All logs (transaction, history, debugging, error) </li>
    <li>History files, trace files </li>
    <li>Database schemas </li>
    <li>Database contents </li>
    <li>Any other place where the cardholder data is stored</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify the storage mechanism used to store the card verification code, such as a program or a database query. Change the storage mechanism so that it does not record the card verification code.</p>
