<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Limit the access to the credential store. Unauthorized access to the credential store can lead to users' credentials being overwritten, thereby allowing the attacker to gain access to application resources without obtaining valid credentials prior to the attack.</p>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>The following code authenticates a user based on their credentials. Because the code discloses the credentials to the user database, anybody with access to the code also has access to the credential store.</p>
<pre><code>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)
{
      boolean valid;
      Connection cn;

      // Prepare credentials before querying the credential store
      ...
      try
      {
            // The application discloses the credentials necessary for
            // accessing the user database
            DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());
            cn = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:oracle:thin:@testbox:1521:orcl2&quot;,
                                             &quot;myapp&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;);
            // Query the credential store and perform the rest
            // of the authentication steps
            ...
      }
      catch (SQLException se)
      {
            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms
            return false;
      }

      return valid;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>The following code authenticates a user based on their credentials. The code relies on other parts of the application to handle database connectivity. Therefore, the code does not reveal the application's credentials to the credential store.</p>
<pre><code>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)
{
      boolean valid;
      // Prepare credentials before querying the credential store
      ...
      try
      {
            // The credentials to the application's user database
            // are not hard-coded in the authentication routine
            cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();
            // Query the credential store and perform the rest
            // of the authentication steps
            ...
      }
      catch (SQLException se)
      {
            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms
            return false;
      }
      return valid;
}
</code></pre>
