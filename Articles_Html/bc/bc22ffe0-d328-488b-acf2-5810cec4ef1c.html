<p>##What to Do##</p>
<p>Use CloudWatch to collect and track details, and monitor your resource and application performance in AWS. Set alarms in CloudWatch to send notifications when monitored resources trigger built-in or user-defined metrics. For example, monitor CPU and disk usage of an EC2 instance and use this information to determine whether additional instances are required to handle increased load.</p>
<p>##Why##</p>
<p>Cloud monitoring provides performance and cost benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-used resources can be stopped to reduce cost</li>
<li>Required load changes in EC2 can be justified with metrics</li>
<li>System-wide visibility of operations can be measured for utilization, performance, and operational health characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>##How##</p>
<p>The following steps summarize the publishing of metrics to CloudWatch.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Access the console.</strong>  Open the CloudWatch console and change the region if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set Up the Command Line Interface.</strong> Use the CloudWatch command line interface (CLI) or the AWS CLI by installing and configuring each. Before you can use either CLI, however, install and configure the tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define the Data Configuration.</strong> Choose appropriate names for the metric and namespace. For a latency example, a metric name of <code>RequestLatency</code> works well. Enter your latency-defining data points into the <code>GetStarted</code> namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Metrics to CloudWatch.</strong> Publish data points to CloudWatch through a command prompt. You enter the command <code>aws cloudwatch put-metric-data</code> with options for metric name, namespace, <code>RequestLatency</code>, and interval. Repeat this command to enter remaining data points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get Statistics From CloudWatch.</strong> Retrieve statistics based on the published metrics with the command <code>aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics</code>. To this command add switches for start-time and end-time that are far enough in the past to include the earliest time stamp published. The CLI returns a JSON similar to the following example:
<code>{ &quot;Datapoints&quot;: [], &quot;Label&quot;: &quot;Request:Latency&quot; }</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>View Graphs with the Console.</strong> Open the CloudWatch console and change the region if necessary. Access the CloudWatch Metrics by Category section. Search for RequestLatency. Check the box to view a graph of the RequestLatency metric. Change the graph by selecting different statistic and periods from the list. Create an Alarm for this metric if needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
