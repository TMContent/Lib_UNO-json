<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that your application uses a least-privileged service account is used for running ASP.NET applications.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>On IIS 5, ASP.NET Web applications run by default using the least privileged ASPNET account. On IIS 6 and later, they run inside an application pool using the least privileged Network Service account. If you need to use a custom service account to run your ASP.NET Web application, create a least-privileged account. You might need to create a custom service account to isolate your application from other applications on the same server or to be able to audit each application separately. </p>
  <p>
    <b>To create a least privileged account</b>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Create a local or domain Windows account. </p>
      <li>
        <p />Run the following Aspnet_regiis.exe command to assign the relevant ASP.NET permissions to the account: <p><b>aspnet_regiis.exe -ga machineName\userName</b></p><p>On Windows Server 2003 and later, running the Aspnet_regiis.exe -ga command will add the account to the IIS_WPG group. The IIS_WPG group provides the <b>Log on as a batch job</b> user right and ensures that the necessary file system permissions are granted. </p><li><p>Use the Local Security Policy tool to grant the Windows account the <b>Deny logon locally</b> user right. This reduces the privileges of the account and prevents anyone logging onto Windows locally with the account. </p><li><p>Use IIS Manager to create an application pool running under the new account's identity and assign your ASP.NET application to the pool.<b></b></p></li></li></li>
    </li>
  </ol>
