<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that if using SSL is not possible&nbsp;in&nbsp;your application, the slidingExpiration attribute is set to false and limited authentication cookie time-outs are used. </p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>If you cannot use SSL, limit the cookie lifetime to reduce the time window in which an attacker can use a captured cookie to gain access to your application with a spoofed identity. The default timeout for an authentication cookie is 30 minutes. Consider reducing this to 10 minutes as shown here.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;forms timeout="00:10:00" slidingExpiration="true" ... /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The <b>slidingExpiration="true"</b> setting ensures that the expiration period is reset after each Web request. With the preceding configuration, this means that the cookie only times out after a 10 minute period of inactivity.</p>
  <p>If you are in a scenario where you are concerned about cookie hijacking, consider reducing the timeout and setting <b>slidingExpiration</b>=<b>"false"</b>. If sliding expiration is turned off, the authentication cookie expires after the timeout period whether or not the user is active. After the timeout period, the user must re-authenticate.</p>
