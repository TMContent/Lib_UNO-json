<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Don't use WS-Routing. If you need this functionality, use WS-Addressing instead and protect Web Service connections using TLS.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Don't use WS-Routing, because WS-Routing is vulnerable to routing detour attacks. The WS-Routing protocol doesn't have sufficient security features, so it should be avoided.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>To avoid using WS-Routing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find code that uses WS-Routing.</strong> Ask developers whether the application actually uses WS-Routing. Review application code to find code that uses WS-Routing.</li>
<li><strong>Determine whether SOAP message routing functionality is needed.</strong> Most real-life applications that use Web Services can be implemented without using SOAP message routing. Review application requirements to determine whether SOAP message routing is necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Remove or replace code that uses WS-Routing.</strong> If SOAP message routing is not necessary, then remove the code that uses it. If SOAP message routing is necessary, rewrite code that uses WS-Routing to use WS-Addressing instead.</li>
</ol>
