<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 8.1.6</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The user should be locked out after repeatedly entering invalid authentication credentials.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Locking the terminal after repeated failed authentication attempts ensures that an attacker cannot guess the password in a timely manner.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if controls are in place to lock a user account after six failed logon attempts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this
 page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the Group Policy Object Editor.</strong>&nbsp;Navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that the "Account lockout threshold" policy is used.</strong> For each relevant domain, check that there is a linked group policy object that enables the "Account lockout threshold" policy. The "Account lockout threshold" policy is not enabled
 on Windows 2003 and 2008 by default.&nbsp;The "Account lockout threshold" policy is located under "Windows Settings", "Security Settings", "Account Policies", “Account Lockout", "Account lockout threshold". Verify that "Account lockout threshold" is set to 6 failed
 attempts or less.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that user accounts are locked after six failed logon attempts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this
 page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Edit or create a Group Policy Object (GPO).</strong> To create and activate a new Group Policy Object (GPO), launch "The Group Policy Management" console, right click on the domain and select "Create and Link a GPO Here." To edit an existing GPO,
 navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit" - this will open the "Group Policy Object Editor." To change the settings of a GPO using the "Group Policy Object Editor, navigate the folders
 to find the setting of interest, double click on it, set the desired option(s).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable&nbsp;the "Account lockout threshold" policy.</strong>&nbsp;The "Account lockout threshold" policy is located under "Windows Settings", "Security Settings", "Account Policies", “Account Lockout", "Account lockout threshold". Set the "Account lockout
 threshold" setting to 6 failed attempts.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
