<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <p>Scala and Play Framework 2.1.0+<br /></p>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Implement authentication on the server-side.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Use server-side authentication because client-side authentication is easy to bypass.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To implement server-side authentication, use authentication controls provided by the framework, or use any well-known third-party authentication library. If you have to implement your own authentication controls, design them to perform authentication on the server-side.</p>
