  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that the sizeof() function is used to determine sizes of objects and types instead of hardcoding memory sizes of objects.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Different platforms may represent the same data structures differently in memory. Using hardcoded values for object memory sizes may result in errors when performing memory management operations.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Identify all code where it is necessary to calculate sizes of objects in memory. Verify that the sizeof() function is used to determine sizes of objects in memory.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use sizeof() to measure sizes of objects in memory.</p>
