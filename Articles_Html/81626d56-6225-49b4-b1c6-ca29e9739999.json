If the compromised account has administrative privileges, the attacker might be able to take over the application and execute arbitrary code, thus taking over the server. Taking over the server gives the attacker complete access to the data available to the application server and allows him to leverage the server for additional attacks.\n</p><p>\nEncryption key guessing attacks are usually aimed at recovering cryptographic keys used to secure data at rest. If the attacker has downloaded or somehow acquired encrypted data without the matching encryption key(s), the attacker might attempt to guess the key with the goal of recovering the encrypted data. \n</p><h2>Countermeasures</h2><p>To mitigate brute forcing, throttle sensitive and resource intensive operations and use strong cryptography and keys. Using strong cryptography and keys virtually nullifies the potential impact of brute force attacks against the encryption keys. \n</p><p>\nThough there is no way to completely prevent brute force attacks, these mitigations create conditions in which a very large amount of resources is required for an attack to be successful, making it improbable that an attack of such magnitude will take place. \n</p>\n<h2>Application Check</h2><p>To make sure that brute forcing is mitigated, verify that sensitive and resource intensive operations are throttled and that strong cryptography and keys are used.\n</p><h2>Specific Technologies</h2><ul><li> <a href=\"f4aa726a-7653-400f-af11-f0552459fdcf\">ASP.NET Brute Force</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"54d5cd3a-9490-4e6e-971a-b90ff2508d7d\">Java Brute Force</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"5716915d-e015-438a-9f33-e816da858104\">C++ Brute Force</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"b4f63ea0-7221-42b5-a55b-efcb55f40d5f\">PHP Brute Force</a></li></ul>"
