<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to encrypt the communication channel between two servers and to restrict which computers can communicate with one another. For example, you can help secure a database server by establishing a policy that permits requests only from a trusted client computer, such as an application or Web server. You can also restrict communication to specific IP protocols and TCP/UDP ports. </p>
  <p>Use SSL instead of IPSec when you need detailed channel protection for a particular application instead of for all applications and services running on a computer. </p>
