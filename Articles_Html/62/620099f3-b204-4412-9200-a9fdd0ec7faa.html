  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that&nbsp;keys&nbsp;stored in configuration files are encrypted. Ensure that&nbsp;keys used to encrypt other keys are stored separately from the keys used to encrypt data.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The keys should be encrypted when stored to prevent an attacker gaining access to them in the event of a successful compromise.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Find where the keys are stored. Make sure that the keys are encrypted when they are stored. Make sure that the keys used to encrypt other keys are stored separately from the keys used to encrypt data.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Find where the encryption keys used to encrypt data are stored. Choose an encryption suite that provides secure cryptography. Use the chosen encryption application to secure the stored keys. Designate a separate secure storage location for the key-encrypting
 keys.</p>
