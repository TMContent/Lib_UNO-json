      "Applications that use authentication need a method for storing credentials. Credentials may be stored for authenticating users to the application or for the application to authenticate to external services. One of the simplest ways to store the credentials is to hard-code them into the application. This approach is not secure, because anyone with access to the application code is able to recover these credentials. Once an attacker has recovered the credentials, he can use them to authenticate with the application or to access the external services.",
