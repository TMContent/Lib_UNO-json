<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Set the &quot;Secure&quot; flag on all sensitive cookies to protect the contents of the sensitive cookies from eavesdropping attacks. Setting the &quot;Secure&quot; flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured by TLS. The &quot;HTTPOnly&quot; flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script - this measure helps reduce the potential damage of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<pre><code>sensitiveCookie.setSecure(true);
sensitiveCookie.setHttpOnly(true);
</code></pre>
