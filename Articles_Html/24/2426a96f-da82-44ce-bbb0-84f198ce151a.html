  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Ensure that you do not echo any untrusted input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Echoing untrusted input may make client applications that rely on your service susceptible to malicious input attacks. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Consider using this guideline when you are validating messages from your clients.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Do not echo input back to the user without first validating and/or encoding the data. Echoing input directly back to the user may make client applications that rely on your service susceptible to malicious input attacks, such as cross-site scripting.</p>
