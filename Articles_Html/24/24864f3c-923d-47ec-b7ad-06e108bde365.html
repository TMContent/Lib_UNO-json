These include <b>AdjustTokenGroups</b>, <b>AdjustTokenPrivileges</b>, <b>SetTokenInformation</b>, <b>and GetTokenInformation</b>. Other unsafe APIs include credential management functions, including functions that create tokens, such as <b>LogonUser</b> and <b>LogonUserEx</b>, crypto API functions that can decrypt and access private keys, memory management functions that can read and write to memory and Local Security Authority (LSA) functions that can access sensitive system data.</p>
