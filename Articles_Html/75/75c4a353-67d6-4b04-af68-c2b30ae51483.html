<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that your application sets the <strong>httpOnlyCookies</strong> attribute to true on the authentication cookie to prevent client-side script from accessing the cookie.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Set the <b>httpOnlyCookies</b> attribute on the authentication cookie. Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 supports this attribute, which prevents client-side script from accessing the cookie from the <b>document.cookie</b> property. The <b>System.Net.Cookie</b> class supports an <b>HttpOnly</b> property. The <b>HttpOnly</b> property is always set to true by forms authentication </p>
