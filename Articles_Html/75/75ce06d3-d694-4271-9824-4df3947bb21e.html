  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Write code in such a way that only dynamically allocated memory is explicitly deallocated.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Deleting objects that were not allocated dynamically may result in an arbitrary code execution vulnerability if that memory is later reused by calling the new operator.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that only dynamically allocated memory is freed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Search for deallocation code.</strong> Review code to find all places where memory is being deallocated by the delete operator or free() function calls.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Identify objects being deleted.</strong> Search for the declarations of the objects that are being deleted.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Remove unnecessary deallocation code.</strong> Remove all delete operators and free() function calls that delete objects, which are not created by calling the new operator.</p>
