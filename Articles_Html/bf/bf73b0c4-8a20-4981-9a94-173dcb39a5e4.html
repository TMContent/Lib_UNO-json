</ul><h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that Apache is configured to use only strong TLS ciphers.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Using strong encryption algorithms with TLS helps reduce the risk of successful eavesdropping attacks and helps with regulatory compliance.
</p><h2>How to Check</h2><p>To verify that Apache is configured to use only strong TLS ciphers, view the httpd.conf files and check the following settings: "SSLProtocol" and "SSLCipherSuite". The recommended settings are:
</p><pre>

SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2:!MD5:@STRENGTH
SSLHonorCipherOrder on

</pre><p>
These settings enable only the TLS protocol and only the strong encryption cipher suites.
</p><p>
It may also be a good idea to check for the following line in case of old versions of apache/mod_ssl:
</p><pre>

SSLInsecureRenegotiation off

</pre><h2>How to Fix</h2><p>To use only strong TLS algorithms, edit the httpd.conf file to include the following settings:
</p><pre>

SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2:!MD5:@STRENGTH
SSLHonorCipherOrder on

</pre><p>
These settings enable only the TLS protocol and only the strong encryption cipher suites.
