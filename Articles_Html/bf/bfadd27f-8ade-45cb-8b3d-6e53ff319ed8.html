<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that every password field is masked, i.e., the field displays identical characters for each character of the password. For example, when a user enters the password <font face="Courier New">password</font>, the masked field may look like <font face="Courier New"><em>********</em>.</font></p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Masking password fields helps protect user passwords from someone that may be looking at the screen.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that every password field is masked:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify every password field in the application.</strong>&nbsp;Review all the pages in the application to find every password-type field. Password-type fields include secret answers, CVV, PIN, and other data which are equivalent to passwords.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that every password field is masked.</strong>&nbsp;View each browser page that contains a password input field, and verify that each password input field is masked.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To mask all password fields:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify every password field in the application.</strong>&nbsp;Review all the pages in the application to find every password-type field. Password-type fields include secret answers, CVV, PIN, and other data which are equivalent to passwords.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Mask user input in every password field.</strong>&nbsp;There are different approaches to masking user input:</p>
      <p>Masking is usually done by using a "<em>password</em>" type HTML input field, as follows:<br /></p>
      <pre>&lt;form&gt;<br />&lt;input type="password" name="pass" autocomplete="off" /&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt; <br /></pre>
      <font face="Arial">Set the
              <font face="Courier New">autocomplete</font> attribute to <font face="Courier New">off</font> to prevent the user's browser from caching the entered password.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Use masking with custom controls.</b> If you are using third party controls for password fields, choose ones that mask user input. If you are implementing custom controls for password fields, implement these controls in such a way that they mask user input.</p>
