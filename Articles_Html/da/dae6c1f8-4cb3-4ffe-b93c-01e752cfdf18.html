<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 7.1.4</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The data control policy should require documented authorization for all access. The access authorization document should state granted privileges. The access privileges should be authorized by management.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Access authorization documents help define privileges and identify who authorized them.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the network documentation to make sure it includes access authorization documents&nbsp;authorized by management. Check the authorization documents to make sure they explicitly define access privileges.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify the job functions of each employee. Identify the data access required for each employee. Define the data access privileges for each employee based on job responsibilities. Have the management review and authorize the data access privilege specifications.
 Once approved, implement the data access control systems. Attach the access authorization documents to the network documentation. These documents may be paper or electronic.</p>
