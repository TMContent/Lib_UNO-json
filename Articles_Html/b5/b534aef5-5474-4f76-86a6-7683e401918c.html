<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 3.6.4</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The key management procedures should require the keys to be changed at least annually.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Changing encryption keys periodically makes it more difficult for an attacker to get access to a valid key.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the key management procedures in the information security policy to make sure they require the encryption keys to be changed at least annually.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Add a requirement to change the encryption at least annually to the information security policy as a part of the key management procedures. Change the encryption keys at least once a year.</p>
