  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that your application blocks protected file types by using HttpForbiddenHandler.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To prevent protected files being downloaded over HTTP, map them to the ASP.NET <b>HttpForbiddenHandler</b>. HTTP handlers are located in the machine-level Web.config file beneath the &lt;<b>httpHandlers</b>&gt; element. HTTP handlers are responsible for processing Web requests for specific file extensions. </p>
  <p>Many well-known file extensions are already mapped to <b>System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler</b>. For .NET Framework resources, if you do not use a particular file extension, map the extension to <b>System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler</b> in the machine-level Web.config file, as shown here.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;add verb="&#42;" path="&#42;.asmx" type="System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>This example assumes that your Web server does not host Web services, so the .asmx file extension is mapped to <b>System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler</b>. If a client requests a path that ends with .asmx, ASP.NET returns a message that says, "This type of page is not served." If your application uses other files with extensions not already mapped, also map these to <b>System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler</b>.</p>
