<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Mask all password fields - use input controls that hide user input for password fields by covering user input with a "mask", typically a character, such as "*". When a user enters a password "<em>password</em>", the masked field may look like "<em>********</em>".</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Masking password fields helps protect user passwords from someone that may be looking at their screen.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To mask all password fields:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify every password field in the application.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Review all the pages in the application to find every password-type field. Password-type fields include secret answers, CVV, PIN, and other data which are equivalent to passwords.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Mask user input in every password field.</strong>&amp;nbsp;There are different approaches to masking user input:</p>
      <p>Masking is usually done by using a "<em>password</em>" type HTML input field, as follows:<br /></p>
      <pre>&lt;form&gt;<br />&lt;input type="password" name="pass" autocomplete="off" /&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt; <br /></pre>
      <font face="Arial">Set the
              <font face="Courier New">autocomplete</font> attribute to <font face="Courier New">off</font> to prevent the user's browser from caching the entered password.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Use masking with custom controls.</b> If you are using third party controls for password fields, choose ones that mask user input. If you are implementing custom controls for password fields, implement these controls in such a way that they mask user input.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
