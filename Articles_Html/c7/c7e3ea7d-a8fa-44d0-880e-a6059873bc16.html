<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>An ASP.NET application is under attack by a malicious user. One side effect of the attack is a set of application exceptions when connecting to and retrieving data from the database. Unfortunately the application doesn't log exception details to the server, so this debugging and auditing information is lost forever.</p>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>An ASP.NET application is under attack by a malicious user. One side effect of the attack is a set of application exceptions when connecting to and retrieving data from the database. Fortunately the application logs exception details to the server, so this debugging and auditing information is discovered by the site admin and delivered to the development team for further analysis.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;%@ Application Language=&quot;C#&quot; %&gt;
 &lt;%@ Import Namespace=&quot;System.Diagnostics&quot; %&gt;
  &lt;script language=&quot;C#&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
 void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {
    //get reference to the source of the exception chain
    Exception ex = Server.GetLastError().GetBaseException();
     // log the details of the exception and page state to the
    // event log.
    EventLog.WriteEntry(&quot;My Web Application&quot;,
      &quot;MESSAGE: &quot; + ex.Message +
       &quot;\nSOURCE: &quot; + ex.Source,
       EventLogEntryType.Error);
     // Optional e-mail or other notification here...
 }
   &lt;/script&gt;
