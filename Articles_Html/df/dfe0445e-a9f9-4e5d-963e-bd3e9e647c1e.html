<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>SAP ABAP</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Use the ABAP central library function <code>ESCAPE</code>, or the Class implementation in <code>CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG</code>, to encode (escape) echoed untrusted data used by your program.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>When the built-in function (<code>ESCAPE</code>) or Class implementation (<code>CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG</code>) are used for encoding untrusted data, the application is protected from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Encoding or escaping data ensures that it is treated as literal text, and not executed as script.</p>
<p>Application vulnerability to XSS is on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 list for critical web application security flaws. XSS is a programming error which is highlighted by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) project. By including built-in mitigation techniques, your application is protected from XSS security threats.</p>
<h2>When</h2>
<p>Always use a provided method to prevent XSS. Never echo untrusted or user-modifiable data back to the user without appropriate encoding. The ABAP built-in <code>ESCAPE</code> function was made available as of SAP_BASIS 731. ABAP code for previous versions should use Class <code>CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG</code> to encode user input. Previous mitigation techniques used should be carefully reviewed and replaced with the most recent function available.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>These steps encode the data in echoed untrusted data:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify all sources of user input.</strong> Determine all possible tainted inputs to the application. The following list includes some common input sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form Fields</li>
<li>Query strings</li>
<li>Databases and data access methods</li>
<li>Cookie collection</li>
<li>Session and application variables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify all output that includes user input.</strong> Trace all inputs to the system and determine which code will output it as a part of HTML, URL, JavaScript, CSS and XML contexts. Make a spreadsheet that contains all of this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encode all untrusted data.</strong> Use <code>ESCAPE</code> to encode data that gets included in HTTP response headers. Encode the data at the last possible moment before displaying it to reduce the possibility of double-encoding bugs. The following shows methods for various contexts:</p>
<pre><code> * HTML or XML
 out = escape(val = val format = cl_abap_format=&gt;e_xss_ml)

 * JavaScript
 out = escape(val = val format = cl_abap_format=&gt;e_xss_js)

 * URL
 out = escape(val = val format = cl_abap_format=&gt;e_xss_url)

 * CSS
 out = escape(val = val format = cl_abap_format=&gt;e_xss_css)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encode all untrusted data (alternate method).</strong> If the 'ESCAPE' method is unavailable use <code>ESCAPE_XSS_XML_HTML</code> to encode data at the last possible moment before displaying it to reduce the possibility of double-encoding bugs. The following shows methods for various contexts:</p>
<pre><code> * HTML or XML
 out = CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG=&gt;ESCAPE_XSS_XML_HTML(val)

 * JavaScript
 out = CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG=&gt;ESCAPE_XSS_JAVASCRIPT(val)

 * URL
 out = CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG=&gt;ESCAPE_XSS_URL(val)

 * CSS
 out = CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG=&gt;ESCAPE_XSS_CSS(val)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
