<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Encrypt the communication channels when interacting with other software across the network. Encrypting the communication links allows the application to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.</p>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>The following code establishes a connection between two servers. Unfortunately, the communication is not encrypted; therefore, it is possible for an attacker to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>
<pre><code>String remoteHost = &quot;server02.example.com&quot;;
int remotePort = &quot;1337&quot;;

Socket sock = new Socket(remoteHost, remotePort);
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream());
BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(isr);
PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>The following code establishes a connection between two servers. Because the communication is encrypted, the confidentiality of the data in transit is preserved; therefore, it is impossible for an attacker to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>
<pre><code>String remoteHost = &quot;server02.example.com&quot;;
int remotePort = &quot;1337&quot;;

SSLSocketFactory sslSF = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket sslSock = (SSLSocket) sslSF.createSocket(remoteHost, remotePort);

InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(sslSock.getInputStream());
BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(isr);
PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
</code></pre>
