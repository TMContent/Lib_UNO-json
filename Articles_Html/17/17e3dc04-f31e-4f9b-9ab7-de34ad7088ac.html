<h1>Description</h1><p>An insufficiently protected credential weakness occurs when the application doesn't store or transmit the authentication credentials securely. </p><ul>
<li>If the passwords are not hashed and salted, an attacker might be able to recover stored passwords after compromising the application. </li>
<li>If the passwords or hashes are not encrypted during transmission, an attacker might be able to intercept passwords or hashes via a man-in-the-middle attack. </li>
<li>If passwords are hard-coded, then the attacker will be able to recover them by reverse engineering application code. The attacker has to get the copy of the code for that to be possible, but that is usually a minor obstacle and does not provide sufficient protection. </li>
<li>If the password is blank or null, the purpose of authentication is largely defeated, as the attacker can log in without supplying a password at all. </li>
</ul><p>
All applications that use authentication are potentially affected by insufficiently protected credential weakness vulnerabilities. 
</p><h1>Impact</h1><p>An insufficiently protected credential vulnerability makes it easier for an attacker to gain access to the authentication credentials. Usually, some other vulnerability has to be present for the attacker to recover the credentials. Once the attacker has the credentials, they can impersonate the user whose credentials have been compromised. 
</p><p>
Malicious hackers usually target privileged accounts to take over the application. After taking over the application, an attacker might leverage other vulnerabilities to take over the application platform and use it to pivot for other attacks. Compromising the application also gives the attacker access to user data, thus enabling them to impersonate the user. 
</p><h1>Countermeasures</h1><p>To prevent this vulnerability type, use PBKDF2 to secure passwords.
