It also enables you to gather operations data; for example, to track what business important operations are being carried out and by whom etc. For, instance you could track usage of methods that relate to financial transactions or access to sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a class library and a class that inherits from WebSuccessAuditEvent that displays some business information, such as bank account transactions.</li>
    <li>Configure your WCF Service for Health Monitoring</li>
    <li>Instrument the WCF Service by raising the custom event in a service contract.</li>
    <li>Verify the Service Events in the Event Log after calling the service method from a Test client.</li>
