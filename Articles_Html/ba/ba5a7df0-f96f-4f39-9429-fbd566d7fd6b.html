<h2>Applies To</h2><ul><li> ASP.NET 4.0</li>
</ul><h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that WS-Routing is not used.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Don't use WS-Routing, because WS-Routing is vulnerable to routing detour attacks. The WS-Routing protocol doesn't have sufficient security features, so it should be avoided. 
</p><h2>How to Check</h2><p>To check whether WS-Routing is used, ask developers whether the application actually uses WS-Routing, and review application code to find code that uses WS-Routing.  Search for keywords like "WS-Routing" and "r:path" to help find code that uses WS-Routing. 
</p><p>
If WS-Routing is used, the code that uses it should be either removed or changed to use WS-Addressing instead.
</p><h2>How to Fix</h2><p>To avoid using WS-Routing:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Find code that uses WS-Routing.</strong> Ask developers whether the application actually uses WS-Routing. Review application code to find code that uses WS-Routing.</li>
<li> <strong>Determine whether SOAP message routing functionality is needed.</strong> Most real-life applications that use Web Services can be implemented without using SOAP message routing. Review application requirements to determine whether SOAP message routing is necessary.</li>
<li> <strong>Remove or replace code that uses WS-Routing.</strong> If SOAP message routing is not necessary, then remove the code that uses it. If SOAP message routing is necessary, rewrite code that uses WS-Routing to use WS-Addressing instead.</li>
