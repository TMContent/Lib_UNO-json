<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The software imports, requires, or includes executable functionality (such as a library) from a source that is outside of the intended control sphere.</p>
  <p>When including third-party functionality, such as a web widget, library, or other source of functionality, the software must effectively trust that functionality. Without sufficient protection mechanisms, the functionality could be malicious in nature (either
 by coming from an untrusted source, being spoofed, or being modified in transit from a trusted source). The functionality might also contain its own weaknesses, or grant access to additional functionality and state information that should be kept private to
 the base system, such as system state information, sensitive application data, or the DOM of a web application.</p>
  <p>This might lead to many different consequences depending on the included functionality, but some examples include injection of malware, information exposure by granting excessive privileges or permissions to the untrusted functionality, DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities,
 stealing user's cookies, or open redirect to malware (CWE-601).</p>
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>The idea seems simple enough (not to mention cool enough): you can make a lot of smaller parts of a document (or program), then combine them all together into one big document (or program) by "including" or "requiring" those smaller pieces. This is a common
 enough way to build programs. Combine this with the common tendency to allow attackers to influence the location of some of these pieces - perhaps even from the attacker's own server - then suddenly you're importing somebody else's code. In these Web 2.0 days,
 maybe it's just "the way the Web works," but not if security is a consideration.</p>
  <h2>Mitigation</h2>
  <p>The following mitigation methods for incorrect permission assignment for critical resources vulnerabilities are available:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use a secure framework.</strong> Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use reference maps.</strong> When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.
 For example, ID 1 could map to "<em>inbox.txt</em>" and ID 2 could map to "<em>profile.txt</em>". Features such as the
<em>ESAPI AccessReferenceMap</em> provide this capability.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use server-side security checks.</strong> For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying
 values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use a sandbox.</strong> Run your code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or
 which commands can be executed by your software. OS-level examples include the Unix
<em>chroot</em> jail, <em>AppArmor</em>, and <em>SELinux</em>. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example,
<em>java.io.FilePermission</em> in the <em>Java SecurityManager</em> allows you to specify restrictions on file operations. This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of your application may still be
 subject to compromise. Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.
<br /><strong>Note:</strong> The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting
 the portion of the file system that can be accessed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use the principle of least privilege.</strong> Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That
 way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Assume all input is malicious.</strong> Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or
 transform it into something that does. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that
 they should be rejected outright.<br />
When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an
 example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if you are expecting colors such as "red" or "blue."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use white-list input validation.</strong> For filenames, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators
 such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a whitelist of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Store application files outside of the web root.</strong> Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities
 to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly
 requested, and it can exit immediately. This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce your attack surface.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all sources of input.</strong> Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results,
 request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls. Many file inclusion problems occur because the programmer
 assumed that certain inputs could not be modified, especially for cookies and URL components.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>(Optional) Use a web application firewall.</strong> Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency
 prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.
<br /><strong>Note:</strong> An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that
 receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.</p>
