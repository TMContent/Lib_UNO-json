<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Convert integers in a way that does not cause truncation or lose sign information.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>If data is lost during conversion, an unpredictable/unintended value may be stored in a variable. If this variable is used for program flow control, memory operations, or array indexing, an arbitrary code execution vulnerability may result.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>Identify all integer conversion operations. Add range checks to verify that the result of integer conversion is valid before assigning the result to a variable.</p>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>The following code may result in truncation, because an unsigned integer has a larger maximum value than a signed integer. The exact error may be different on different platforms.</p>
<pre><code>unsigned short a = 50000;
signed short b = static_cast&lt;signed short&gt;(a);
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>To fix the problem example above, add range checks before assigning the result of conversion to a variable.</p>
<pre><code>unsigned short a = 50000;
if (a &gt; SHRT_MIN &amp;&amp; a &lt; SHRT_MAX) signed short b = static_cast&lt;signed short&gt;(a);
else {/*handle error*/}
</code></pre>
