<p>Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow Cross-Site Scripting to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Examples of libraries and frameworks that make it easier to generate properly encoded output include Microsoft's
<em>Anti-XSS</em> library, the OWASP <em>ESAPI Encoding</em> module, and Apache <em>
Wicket</em>.</p>
