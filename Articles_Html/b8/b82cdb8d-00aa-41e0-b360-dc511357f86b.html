<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>During program startup, explicitly set the default permissions or umask to the most restrictive setting possible. Also set the appropriate permissions during program installation. This will prevent you from inheriting insecure permissions from any user who
 installs or runs the program. This principle reduces the risk and the impact of potential vulnerabilities by reducing the attack surface.</p>
