<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>Encode XML data. The platform will often take care of this for you, but make sure that it gets done.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Encode data that is included in XML documents for the appropriate context to prevent XML injection vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>To encode XML data:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify XML data used by the application.</strong> Examine the application design to identify all XML data and XML data types used by the application.</li>
<li><strong>Identify code that handles XML data.</strong> Review application to find code that uses XML data.</li>
<li><strong>Add data validation methods.</strong> Add methods that validate all the data types stored in XML data and used by the application.</li>
<li><strong>Use validation methods.</strong> Call the data validation methods from the previous step whenever loading XML data. Validation should be performed before encoding.</li>
<li><strong>Encode XML data.</strong> Use the platform's XML encoding functions to encode data used in XML documents. Some XML parsers will encode data fed to them automatically.</li>
</ol>
