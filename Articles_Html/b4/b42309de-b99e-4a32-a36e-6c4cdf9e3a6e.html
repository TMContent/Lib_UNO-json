  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use PHP session management, instead of writing your own.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The framework works on a lower level than the application and is therefore better suited to provide session management. PHP offers mature and simple to use session management functionality.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Please, refer to the link to the PHP manual below for thorough documentation of PHP session management functionality.</p>
