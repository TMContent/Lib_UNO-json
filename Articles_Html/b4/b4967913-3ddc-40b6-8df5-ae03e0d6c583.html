  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Most modern Operating Systems implement user authentication. Use a directory service, such as Microsoft Active Directory, to set up centralized authentication and user management in an enterprise environment. Setting up Active Directory is a common IT skill,
 and your company should have at least one person that has it. The actual process involves many steps and varies by environment. Install and configure a domain controller. Join all the workstations to the domain. Create user accounts on the domain controller
 for each authorized user. Configure the access control system. Use the domain controller for authentication in your custom applications.</p>
