<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Avoid storing sensitive data in ViewState.&amp;nbsp; If you need to manage sensitive data, maintain it on the server; for example, maintain it in session state.&amp;nbsp; If your ViewState does contain sensitive data, you should&amp;nbsp;encrypt ViewState. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Although it does protect against tampering, by default, the ViewState does not provide any protection against information disclosure, and thus should not be used for sensitive data.&amp;nbsp; Encryption can be added to the ViewState, but there is a&amp;nbsp;large performance overhead to doing so, both in terms of CPU usage for encryption and the size of the resulting ViewState; the best option is to ensure that no sensitive data is in the ViewState. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Sensitive data should not be stored in the ViewState.&amp;nbsp; If sensitive data&amp;nbsp;must be stored in ViewState for some reason, it should be encrypted.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>The ViewState is a blob of base-64 encoded data stored and submitted as a hidden form element by ASP.NET controls.&amp;nbsp; You can view it by looking at the page source or by using ASP.NET tracing.&amp;nbsp; To ensure that sensitive data is not stored in the view state, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Examine all data which is being placed in the ViewState and ensure that it is not sensitive, either alone or in combination with other data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Move any sensitive data into server-side session variables.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If data cannot be moved into server-side session variables, encrypt the ViewState.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>To Turn off the ViewState</h2>
  <p>If you're not using the ViewState (or don't want sensitive data to be persisted accidentally), you can turn it off at either the tag, page, or application levels with the following code:</p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Per control (on tag)</th>
        <td>
          <pre>&lt;asp:datagrid EnableViewState="false" ... /&gt;</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Per page (in directive)</th>
        <td>
          <pre>&lt;%@ Page EnableViewState="False" ... %&gt;</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Per application (in web.config)</th>
        <td>
          <pre>&lt;Pages EnableViewState="false" ... /&gt;</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2>To Store Session State on the Server Side</h2>
  <p>To store session state on the server side, you can use the <strong>SessionStateModule</strong> class, whose <strong>Contents</strong> collection allows for session objects to be added and retrieve easily.&amp;nbsp; Server-side session state can be stored either in-process, in a seperate state server, or in a SQL server, allowing for flexibility across a variety of configurations</p>
  <h2>To Encrypt the ViewState:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Check that the <b>viewStateEncryptionMode</b> attribute of the <b>&lt;pages&gt;</b> element is set to <b>Always</b>, as shown in the following example. <pre>&lt;pages<br /> ...<br /> viewStateEncryptionMode="Always"<br /> ...<br /> /&gt;</pre><p>If you do not want every page to used encrypted ViewState, check that the <b>viewStateEncryptionMode</b> attribute of the <b>&lt;pages&gt;</b> element is set to <b>Auto</b>, as shown in the following example. </p><pre>&lt;pages<br /> ...<br /> viewStateEncryptionMode="Auto"<br /> ...<br /> /&gt;   </pre><p>Then, from within your code, call the <b>RegisterRequiresViewStateEncryption</b> method as shown in the following example. </p><pre>Page.RegisterRequiresViewStateEncryption();</pre></li>
    <li>Specify the encryption algorithm to use on the <b>validation</b> attribute, as shown in the following example. <pre>&lt;machineKey<br /> ...<br /> validation="AES"<br /> ...<br /> /&gt;</pre><p>The <b>validation</b> attribute is overloaded and can be used to specify either the hashing algorithm or the encryption algorithm.&amp;nbsp; You can specify either <b>3DES</b> or <b>AES</b>.&amp;nbsp; Because <b>AES</b> offers larger key sizes (128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits) than <b>3DES</b> (56 bits), it is considered more secure and should be used.</p></li>
    <li>Review the <b>decryptionKey</b> and <strong>validationKey</strong> attribute of the <b>&lt;machineKey&gt;</b> element: <pre>&lt;machineKey<br /> validationKey="AutoGenerate,IsolateApps"<br />   decryptionKey="AutoGenerate,IsolateApps"<br />   ...<br /> /&gt;</pre><p>Unless your application is installed in a Web farm, you should leave the <b>decryptionKey</b> and <strong>validationKey</strong> attribute with the default values shown in the example. To encrypt ViewState in a web farm, you need to manually set the <b>validationKey</b> and <strong>decryptionKey</strong> valueâ€”these values should be same across all machines in the web farm</p></li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce site sends billing details, including order amounts and (non-public) discount percentages round-trip through the user's browser.&amp;nbsp; All of this information is stored in a ViewState.&amp;nbsp; An attacker can extract all of the information in the ViewState, although they cannot modify it.&amp;nbsp; Thus, their competitors can learn the site's discount structure without having to compromise any server side machines. </p>
  <p />
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce site keeps all billing details in server-side session state after they have been initially submitted by the user, and protects that session state appropriately.&amp;nbsp; Attackers are unable to either view or modify billing details.</p>
