<h1>Applies To</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Write a dedicated logging library or class and use it whenever log entries have to be generated.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A centralized logging subsystem is simpler to maintain and implement correctly.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use this guideline when writing an application that generates log entries.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to centralize logging: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify existing logging functionality.</strong> Examine the application architecture to identify logging facilities, such as the logging API and where audit trails are actually stored. Make a list of APIs used to log events, document how to use them, and where they store logs.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Design the logging subsystem.</strong> Design and implement a class or library specifically for logging. When designing the logging subsystem, consider sending logs to a remote log server. Consider the following factors when designing the logging subsystem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Log throttling</p>
            <li>
              <p>Logging important event details for both successful and failed operations</p>
              <li>
                <p>Logging important security operations</p>
                <li>
                  <p>Logging important business operations</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Monitoring the use of privileged accounts</p>
                    <li>
                      <p>Logging user management events</p>
                      <li>
                        <p>Avoiding including sensitive information in logs</p>
                        <li>
                          <p>Logging unusual activity</p>
                          <li>
                            <p>Sending logs to a centralized server</p>
                          </li>
                        </li>
                      </li>
                    </li>
                  </li>
                </li>
              </li>
            </li>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Implement the logging subsystem.</strong> Write code that generates log entries according to your design.</p>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Use the logging subsystem.</strong> Use the logging class or library whenever logs are generated. If earlier code exists that generates log entries, replace it with calls to the new logging subsystem API.</p>
