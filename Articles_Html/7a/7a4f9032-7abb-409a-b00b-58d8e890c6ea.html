<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that a global exception handler is used to catch unhandled exceptions.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unhandled exceptions can be a serious stumbling block to an application's performance and security. Unhandled exceptions must be avoided as they can result in the application entering an unknown state and/or revealing sensitive internal application details. Using a global exception handler will prevent unhandled exceptions.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that a global exception handler is used to catch unhandled exceptions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Verify that a global exception handler is set.</strong>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that all code that throws exceptions is covered.</strong> Review code to make sure that all scripts that may throw exceptions are covered by the global exception handler.</p>

  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To use a global exception handler to for unhandled exceptions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define a global exception handler. </strong>Write a function that will handle all uncaught exceptions. Place this function in the error handling subsystem. The global exception handler should accept the exception object as a parameter.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Log detailed exception information.</strong> Add code to the global exception handler to get as much information as possible from the exception object that is passed as the parameter. Log the </p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Show a simple error message.</strong> Be careful not to give away too much information to attackers. Write a simple message that lets the user know that the application has crashed, but the situation is under control. Add code that displays the error message to the global exception handler.</p>
          <li>
            <p />
            <strong>Clean up and exit gracefully.</strong> Add code to the global exception handler to do the following as necessary: <ul><li>Close any open file handles. <li>Remove any temporary files used by the application. <li>Check file system permissions and reset them if necessary. <li>Close any open connections, including database connections. <li>Free any external resources in use.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><li><p><strong>Set the global exception handler.</strong> Set the global exception handler somewhere early on in the application flow.</p></li></li>
