  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that the certificate valid from and valid to dates are in range to confirm the validity of your Web server certificate.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>If your Web application supports HTTPS (SSL) over port 443, you must install a server certificate. This is required as part of the session negotiation process that occurs when a client establishes a secure HTTPS session.</p>
  <p>A valid certificate provides secure authentication so that a client can trust the server it is communicating with, and secure communication so that sensitive data remains confidential and tamperproof over the network.</p>
