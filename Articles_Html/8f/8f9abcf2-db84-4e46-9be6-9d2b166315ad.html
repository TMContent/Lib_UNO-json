<h2>What to Do</h2><p>Do not send credentials via unencrypted connections. Use TLS when transmitting credentials.
</p>
<h2>Why</h2><p>Using TLS prevents the credentials from being sniffed or tampered with as they are transmitted over the network. TLS only provides assurance against tampering if valid certificates are used.
</p>
<h2>How</h2><p>To use TLS to protect authentication credentials in transit:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Purchase a valid TLS certificate.</strong> You may purchase a valid TLS key from VeriSign, Thawte, or your web hosting provider. Follow the vendor's instructions for purchasing the TLS certificate. The certificate is usually a .cer file. Make sure the certificate matches all domains used by the application.</li>
<li> <strong>Identify authentication code.</strong> Find the code that sends authentication credentials to the server for verification. Make a spreadsheet about all the code that sends authentication credentials over the network.</li>
<li> <strong>Use TLS to protect authentication credentials in transit.</strong> Modify all code that sends authentication credentials over the network to send these credentials only through sockets protected using TLS. Use valid certificates when opening TLS protected sockets.</li></ol>
