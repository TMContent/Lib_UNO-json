  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that authentication&nbsp;is centralized.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Centralizing authentication mechanisms makes them simpler to maintain.</p>
  <h1>How To Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that authentication mechanisms are centralized, make sure that forms authentication is being used. Forms authentication provides a set of centralized authentication functions implemented by the platform. To determine whether forms authentication is being used, search <em>Web.config </em>files for the following string:</p>
  <pre>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;</pre>
  <p>It is a good idea to review application code to make sure it takes full advantage of functionality provided by forms authentication.</p>
  <h1>How To Fix</h1>
  <p>ASP.NET has great built-in centralized authentication functionality. To use forms authentication, enable and configure the following section in <em>Web.config</em>:</p>
  <pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &lt;/authentication&gt;<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;</pre>
