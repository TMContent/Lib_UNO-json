  "html": "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\n  <p>Ensure that SSL is used to protect authentication credentials and authentication cookies passed between browser and server.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>By using SSL, you make it much more difficult for an attacker to monitor the network connection&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;capture authentication credentials and authentication cookies to gain spoofed access to your application. </p>\n  <p>SSL also can improve user trust in your application as it authenticates the server to the client, thus proving the end point for communications.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>To ensure the forms authentication credentials and the forms authentication cookie is passed from browser to server with SSL, use the following steps:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Ensure that the authentication cookie is passed only over HTTPS connections. <li>Ensure that the <strong>SSLOnly</strong> attribute is set&amp;nbsp;on all authentication and authorization cookies.&amp;nbsp; <li>Ensure that all login forms, password change forms, role/authorization request, editing forms, or other authentication-required pages are only available over SSL and only accept submissions via SSL.&amp;nbsp; </li></li></li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Perform the following tasks to assure that SSL is used to protect user credentials and authentication cookies:</p>\n  <p>\n    <b>Restrict the authentication cookie to HTTPS connections. </b>Cookies support a \"secure\" property that determines whether or not browsers should send the cookie back to the server. With the secure property set, the cookie is sent by the browser only to a secure page that is requested using an HTTPS URL.</p>\n  <p>Set the secure property by using <b>requireSSL=\"true\"</b> on the <b>&lt;forms&gt;</b> element as follows:</p>\n  <pre>&lt;forms loginUrl=\"Secure\\Login.aspx\"<br />       requireSSL=\"true\" . . . /&gt;</pre>\n  <p>\n    <b>Encrypt the cookie and check its integrity. </b>Encrypt the cookie and check its integrity, even if you are using SSL.
