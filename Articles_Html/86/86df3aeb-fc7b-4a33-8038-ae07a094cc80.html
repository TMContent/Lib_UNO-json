  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Configure the anti-virus to update itself and its definition files.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The anti-virus definitions and anti-virus engine have to be updated frequently to be effective because malware threats evolve rapidly.
</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Verify that it is possible to run automatic updates with your anti-virus by referring to the vendor documentation or technical support. The documentation or technical support should provide the exact instructions on how to implement automatic updates. Automatic
 updates are a basic feature of modern anti-virus packages. If your anti-virus does not offer this feature, please consider installing and configuring a different anti-virus.</p>
