  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that the&nbsp;anonymous account does not have write access to Web content directories and cannot execute command-line tools because attackers target this well known account to perform malicious actions.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To secure the anonymous account: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Deny write access to Web content directories</b>. 
<p>Make sure that it is not possible for this account to write to content directories, for example, to deface Web sites. </p><li><b>Restrict access to System tools</b>. 
<p>In particular, restrict access to command-line tools located in \WINNT\System32. </p><li><b>Assign permissions to groups instead of individual accounts</b>. 
<p>Assigning users to groups and applying permissions to groups instead of individual accounts is good practice. For the anonymous account, create a group and add the anonymous account to it and then explicitly deny access to the group for key directories and files. Assigning permissions to a group allows you to more easily change the anonymous account or create additional anonymous accounts because you do not need to recreate the permissions. </p><blockquote><b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IISLockdown denies write access to content directories for the anonymous account by applying a deny write access control entry (ACE) for the Web Anonymous Users and Web Applications groups. It also adds a deny execute ACL on command-line tools.</blockquote><li><b>Use separate accounts for separate applications</b>. 
<p>If your Web server hosts multiple applications, use a separate anonymous account for each application. Add the accounts to an anonymous Web users group, for example, the <b>Web Anonymous Users</b> group created by IISLockdown, and then configure NTFS permissions using this group. </p><p>For more information about using multiple anonymous accounts and hosting multiple applications, see Chapter 20, "<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302436.aspx">Hosting Multiple ASP.NET Applications</a>." </p></li></li></li></li>
