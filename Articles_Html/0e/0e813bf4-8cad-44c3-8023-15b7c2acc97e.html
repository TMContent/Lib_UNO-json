  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that files are opened safely on UN&#42;X systems.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>When opening files, use open() instead of fopen(). fopen() does not indicate if an existing file was opened for writing or if a new file was created. As a result, a program could overwrite or access an unintended file. open() provides the control that fopen() does not.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Search for calls to the fopen() function to make sure it is not used - open() should be used instead.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to open files safely on UN&#42;X systems:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review code.</strong> Search for all calls to the fopen() function.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Use open() instead of fopen().</strong> Replace calls to fopen() with open(). Use open() with the following flags:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>O_CREAT &#124; O_EXCL.</strong> When creating a new file, the call will fail if the file already exists. This prevents the call from overwriting an existing file.</p>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>O_NOFOLLOW.</strong> Ensures that the system will not follow a symlink thereby accessing another file unexpectedly.</p>
            </li>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
