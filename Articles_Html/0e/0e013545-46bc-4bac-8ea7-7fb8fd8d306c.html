  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that data is not lost during integer conversion. Typical errors that may occur are truncation and losing sign information.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If data is lost during conversion, an unpredictable/unintended value may be stored in a variable. If this variable is used for program flow control, memory operations, or array indexing, an arbitrary code execution vulnerability may result.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Identify all integer conversion operations. Make sure that ranges are checked before assigning the result of the conversion to a variable.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify all integer conversion operations. Add range checks to verify that the result of integer conversion is valid before assigning the result to a variable.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code may result in truncation, because an unsigned integer has a larger maximum value than a signed integer. The exact error may be different on different platforms.</p>
  <pre>unsigned short a = 50000;<br />signed short b = static_cast&lt;signed short&gt;(a);</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>To fix the problem example above, add range checks before assigning the result of conversion to a variable.</p>
  <pre>unsigned short a = 50000;<br />if (a &gt; SHRT_MIN && a &lt; SHRT_MAX) signed short b = static_cast&lt;signed short&gt;(a);<br />else &#123;/&#42;handle error&#42;/&#125;</pre>
