</ul><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Store uploaded files in a location that is not web accessible.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Storing uploaded files in a location that is not web accessible prevents shell upload vulnerabilities. Even if an attacker manages to upload a malicious script, they won't be able to execute it if the malicious script is stored in a location that is not accessible from the web.
</p><h2>How</h2><p>To store uploaded files in a location that is not web accessible:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Find all code used to upload files.</strong> Search your application code for calls to move_uploaded_files(). Make a spreadsheet of this code. </li>
<li> <strong>Determine where to store uploaded files.</strong> It's possible to store uploaded files in a folder outside of the web root or in a database.<ol>
<li> Storing uploaded files outside the web root is a strong and easy to implement measure. However, it makes installing the application on a large amount of servers slightly more difficult, because the servers then need to be configured to allow storing files outside of the web root by creating a folder to store the uploaded files and granting the web server permissions to write to that folder. This additional configuration work is why many commercial applications store uploaded files in a web accessible location, and subsequently suffer from shell upload vulnerabilities. </li>
<li> Another mitigation method is to store uploaded files in a database. Files stored in a database cannot be accessed directly via HTTP requests, so even if an attacker is able to upload a shell, they won't be able to access it. If the application is already using a database, there is no additional end-user configuration required. However, this method is harder to code, and there is some maintenance overhead because the database and backups might become quite large. </li></ol></li>
<li> <strong>Change code to store uploaded files outside web root.</strong> Change each piece of code that is used to handle uploaded files so that the uploaded files are stored in the chosen location that is not accessible from the web.</li>
