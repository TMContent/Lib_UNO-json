<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <p />Scala and Play Framework 2.1.0+<p /><h1>What to Do</h1><p>Use only FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption algorithms with TLS. <br /></p><p>In practice, this means using TLS. SSL 3.0 and earlier versions have known vulnerabilities and are not FIPS 140-2 compliant. <br /></p><h1>Why</h1><p>Using strong encryption algorithms with TLS helps reduce the risk of successful eavesdropping attacks and assures regulatory compliance.</p><h1>When</h1><p>Whenever possible, use only FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption algorithms with TLS.<br /></p><h1>How</h1><p>To use strong TLS algorithms, configure the web application server to use TLS 1.2 and not SSL 3.0 or any earlier version of SSL. The exact instructions for doing so are different for different platforms. Please, refer to your web application server's documentation or technical support for detailed instructions on how to configure the server to use TLS.</p>
