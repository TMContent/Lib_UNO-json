<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Use structured exception-handling to avoid unhandled exceptions. Use <b>finally</b> blocks to ensure that resources are released, files are closed, and objects are disposed of&#8212;regardless of whether an exception occurs. The following code example shows to use a <b>finally</b> block to ensure that a database connection is closed promptly. </p>
  <pre>using System.Data.SqlClient;<br />using System.Security;<br />SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("...");<br />try&#123;<br />    conn.Open();<br />    // Do some operation that might cause an exception.<br />    // Calling Close as early as possible.<br />    conn.Close();<br />    // ... other potentially long operations.<br />&#125;<br />finally&#123;<br />    if (conn.State==ConnectionState.Open)<br />        conn.Close();  <br />&#9;// ensure that the connection is closed.<br />&#9;&#125;  </pre>
  <p>To help diagnose security issues, consider adding a <b>catch</b> block for the <b>SecurityException</b> class. <b>SecurityException</b> has been enhanced to provide more information in case of a failed permission demand. Additionally, to diagnose role-based access or identity problems, consider logging the identity at the time of the exception, as shown in the following code example. </p>
  <pre>catch(Exception ex)&#123;...<br />    // Log current identity together with other exception information.<br />    WindowsIdentity wid = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent();...<br />&#125;&nbsp;</pre>
