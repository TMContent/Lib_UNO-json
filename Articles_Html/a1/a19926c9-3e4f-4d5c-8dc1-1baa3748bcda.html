<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure access to your application's log files are restricted. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Logged events often contain internal application details that could enable an attacker to more effectively target your application.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>If your application generates multiple log files, use your application to generate all the log files and follow these steps to ensure they are protected:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify location of logs is not disclosed. </strong>Scan your application's code base to verify that the location of the log files is known only to the internal logging framework.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Ensure appropriate Access Control Lists (ACL) are set. </strong>Verify that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Logs are set with the appropriate file system permissions. <li>All entities, excluding your application and its administrators/developers, are prohibited access to the logs. <li>If your application logs are backed up, verify that the backups are stored in an environment that is secure. <li>Log files are located on a non-system NTFS volume and not on the same volume where the Web site content resides.</li></li></li></li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Ensure that proper log management is in place. </strong>Verify that your application enforces your organization's audit policy with respect to managing its logs. Check that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your application does not erase older log entries before they are deemed expired by your organization's audit policy. <li>If your application performs log rotation, ensure that older logs are stored by a unique identifier to prevent unintentional deletion of older log entries. <li>Your application logs user activity but not user-supplied data. For example, log the event that a user changed their password, but not the password itself. <li>Your application does not append user-supplied data to an exception's message and/or details.</li></li></li></li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Verify that ASP.NET health monitoring is secured. </strong>If your application uses ASP.NET health monitoring (a feature that is enabled by default), check if the following measures are set in place:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Logs are throttled:</strong> Depending on your application's requirements, ensure that your application's logs are properly throttled. Consult the <a href="/article/fc33dfc5-5210-4656-bc27-e43b16c3c89e">Consider Log Throttling</a> guideline for more details. <li><strong>Connection strings are secured:</strong> Ensure that all connection strings that are used by your application's logging framework are properly secured. Use the <a href="/article/1fe40372-6648-4496-8552-794f91ff6bbf">Connection Strings are Secured</a> checklist to aid you in this task.</li></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce site does hundreds of transactions an hour and logs data at the web and database levels, along with a separate security log that monitors all user and security-related events. Unfortunately, the security logs are stored in a location that is hidden in the application's directory tree. An attacker finds the location of the logs and retrieves all user and security-related events.</p>
