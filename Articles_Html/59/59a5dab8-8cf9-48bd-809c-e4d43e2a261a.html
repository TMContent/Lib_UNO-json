  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Install and configure personal firewalls on all mobile and/or employee-owned computers that are used to access the company network. The user should not be able to change the settings of the firewall or disable it.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A compromised personal computer is a threat to the cardholder data environment. A personal firewall offers some protection from network attacks and may prevent remote-control malware from working.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>A personal firewall should be installed when the computer is being configured to remotely access the company network.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to use the Windows Firewall to satisfy PCI DSS Requirement 1.4:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Object Editor".</strong>&nbsp;Click "Start", "Run", type "gpedit.msc", hit "OK". Browse to "Computer Configuration", "Administrative Templates", "Network", "Network Connections", "Windows Firewall".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the firewall configuration. </strong>Enable the "Windows Firewall: Do not allow exceptions" setting in both the Domain Profile and the Standard Profile folders.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Protect all connections.</strong> Enable the "Windows Firewall: Protect all network connections" setting in both the Domain Profile and the Standard Profile folders.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Prevent the user from changing the firewall configuration. </strong>To prevent the user from changing the firewall settings, the user should not be allowed Administrator access, so a restricted account should be created for the user. This may be
 unacceptable if the computer belongs to an employee, in which case, it is recommended that the computer not be allowed to access the company network remotely.</p>
