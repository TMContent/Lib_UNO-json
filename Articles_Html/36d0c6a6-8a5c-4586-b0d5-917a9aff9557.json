      "A cross site request forgery (CSRF) attack occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into loading a page that contains a malicious request.

For many sites, each request automatically sends the victim's credentials, such as the session cookie or authentication credentials.

A common way to perform a zero-click attack is to embed the request in the source of an image.",
