  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that the delete operator is only called on pointers returned by the new operator.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Deleting objects that were not allocated dynamically may result in an arbitrary code execution vulnerability if that memory is later reused by calling the new operator.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Identify code that uses the delete operator. Verify that the delete operator is only called on pointers that are returned by the new operator.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify code that uses the delete operator on an object that was not dynamically allocated. Remove this code - let the compiler handle memory of the objects that are not dynamically allocated.</p>
