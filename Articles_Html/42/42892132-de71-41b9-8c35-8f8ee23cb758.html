<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <p>Scala and Play Framework 2.1.0+</p>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Define a boundary between public and restricted content. For 
instance, anonymous users are restricted to one part of the application,
 while authenticated users can access both parts.<br /></p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Defining a boundary between public and restricted content helps 
establish the check points&nbsp;where access will be allowed&nbsp;to the 
restricted content.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application has access control that&nbsp;restricts certain users
 to specific resources, then define a boundary between those resources. <br /></p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To define the boundary between public and restricted content:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine roles.&nbsp;</strong>Define the various types of 
users and their rights. Build a security policy for the restricted 
content and base the user groups' privileges around it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define the boundary.&nbsp;</strong>Structure the content according to access and logical orders. Try to use a modular approach when establishing the boundary.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Separate on disk.&nbsp;</strong>Once the boundaries have been
 established, reflect these boundaries onto the local file system. 
Separate the restricted content from the public content on disk.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set proper permissions.&nbsp;</strong>Set proper permissions 
to the restricted content. Dedicate a special directory for the 
restricted content and require valid access before accessing content 
within this directory. These permissions can be enforced at the 
application, server and operating system levels, depending on the 
environment in use.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
