<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Write applications that include important details in log entries.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Log event entries should include important details so that the contents of the logs are useful for forensics and system administration.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to add code that logs important event details:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify existing logging functionality.</strong> Look for libraries or classes that are designed specifically for logging. Make a list of functions used to generate log entries and document them.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Centralize logging.</strong> If a dedicated logging library or class doesn't exist, design and write one. Consider implementing functionality for sending logs to an external log server. One common protocol for sending logs to a log server is syslog (RFC 5424).</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Implement logging.</strong> Add code that records the following details in log entries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>User identification<li>Type of event<li>Date and time stamp<li>Success or failure indication<li>Source of event<li>Names or other identifiers of affected data or resources</li></li></li></li></li></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
