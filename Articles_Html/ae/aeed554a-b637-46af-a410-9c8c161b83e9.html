<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, use anti-CSRF packages such as the OWASP
<em>CSRFGuard</em>. Another example is the ESAPI <em>Session Management</em> control, which includes a component for CSRF.</p>
