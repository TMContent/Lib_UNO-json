<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 11.2</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Document vulnerability scans.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Vulnerability scans should be documented to prove that they took place and to show what vulnerabilities may have already been found and fixed.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to assure that vulnerability scans are performed and documented in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Conduct vulnerability scans.</strong> Schedule quarterly internal and external vulnerability scans. Perform the vulnerability scans. If a scan is being performed as a result of network changes, it is acceptable to have qualified internal staff perform
 the scan. Required quarterly scans should be performed by a PCI DSS qualified ASV. It may be prudent to conduct a preliminary internal test with the available resources to eliminate the most obvious vulnerabilities, if any, before the ASV comes in.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Fix detected vulnerabilities.</strong> If vulnerabilities are found, fix them and perform the scan again. Repeat scanning and fixing vulnerabilities until the scan returns acceptable results.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Update documentation.</strong> Record the results. Attach them to the security documentation.
</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
