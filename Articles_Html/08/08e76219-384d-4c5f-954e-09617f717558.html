  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that a secure encryption key storage location is used.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>When faced with encryption, intruders attack the most vulnerable aspect: key management. Because keys are used to generate the encryption that protects sensitive data, the keys themselves become sensitive data that needs to be protected.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that a secure key storage location is used:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the need for a key store. </strong>Key stores should be used when your application utilizes crypto keys.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that Java's <em>KeyStore</em> class is used.</strong> Search application code for "<em>KeyStore</em>" to identify whether the <em>KeyStore</em> class is used.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that appropriate permissions are set on the key store directory.</strong> Find the directory where the keystore is located. Verify that the keystore directory is not web-accessible. Verify that strong permissions are set on the keystore directory, so that only the application and the administrators can access it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that keys are not hard-coded into the application.</strong> Review application code to make sure encryption keys are not hard-coded into the application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that keys are unloaded from memory after their use.</strong> Review code that handles encryption keys to make sure that keys are securely removed from memory after being used.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>When considering a key storage location:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the need for a key store. </strong>Key stores should be used when your application utilizes crypto keys. Example:</p>
      <pre>KeyGenerator kgen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");<br />kgen.init(256);SecretKey skey = kgen.generateKey();<br />byte[] rawKey = skey.getEncoded();<br /><br />SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use Java's <em>KeyStore</em> class. </strong>Java offers a key store functionality as part of the Java Runtime Environment. The Java key store requires a master password for retrieving the contents of the key store. The master password should be given to the application at starting time. Use the <em>KeyTool</em> utility to create and manage the keys inside the key store. Example of accessing the key store:</p>
      <pre>String keyStoreName = MyApp.getKeyStoreName();<br />char[] keyStorePass = MyApp.getKeyStorePass();<br />KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());<br />FileInputStream keyStoreFile = new FileInputStream(keyStoreName);<br />keyStore.load(keyStoreFile, keyStorePass);<br />keyStoreFile.close();<br /><br />final String keyName = "MyAppEncryptionKey";<br />// Note: Although the example uses the same password for storing the KeyStore<br />// on disk and adding keys to the KeyStore, the 2 passwords can be different<br />// from one another<br />SecretKey skey = (SecretKey)keyStore.getKey(keyName, keyStorePass);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Protect the key store.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose a key store directory</strong>: Dedicate a directory for storing your application's key store files. Make sure the directory is not web-accessible. This limits the scope of users&nbsp;who can potentially compromise the contents inside the directory. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set appropriate permissions</strong>: Apply filesystem permissions such that the key store files can be only accessed by your application and its administrators.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoid common mistakes.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Do not hard-code keys in the application</strong>: Hard-coding the encryption keys into the source code, hoping that an attacker will not reverse engineer the application, is security through obscurity. A determined attacker will usually find a way to defeat such a mechanism. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Do not place keys into configuration files</strong>: Obfuscating the encryption keys and placing them into configuration files is security through obscurity. A determined attacker will usually find a way to defeat such a mechanism. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unload keys from memory after their use</strong>: Leaving the encryption keys in memory after their final use allows the operating system to page them from memory and onto the hard drive. A determined attacker will usually find a way to obtain the encryption keys from the operating system's page file.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
