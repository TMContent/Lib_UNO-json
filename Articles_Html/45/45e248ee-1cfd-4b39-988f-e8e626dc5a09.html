<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Run or compile your software using features or extensions that automatically provide a protection mechanism that mitigates or eliminates buffer overflows.<br />
For example, certain compilers and extensions provide automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are built into the compiled code. Examples include the Microsoft Visual Studio<em> /GS</em> flag, Fedora/Red Hat
<em>FORTIFY_SOURCE</em> GCC flag, <em>StackGuard</em>, and <em>ProPolice</em>.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms can only detect certain types of overflows. In addition, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.</p>
