<p>ASP.NET is a service side web application framework developed by Microsoft. This framework allows developers to build dynamic content and web applications for both PC and Mobile devices. The following are the most commonly found vulnerabilities used against ASP.NET applications.
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="https://vulnerabilities.teammentor.net/article/5fdf23f4-8ff9-4043-a3bb-2d7d10704b0e">SQL Injection</a> - SQL injection is a type of vulnerability in database access code that allows attackers to execute unauthorized queries on the database. SQL injection typically occurs when an application uses input to construct dynamic SQL statements to access the database. SQL injection may also occur if stored procedures use dynamic queries that include untrusted input. Using the SQL injection attack, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the database with the privileges of the application. </li>
<li> <a href="https://vulnerabilities.teammentor.net/article/ea00a8ee-1248-42b5-9954-439a93fb14d8">Command Injection</a> - Applications often execute external commands as a part of their functionality. If the attacker is able to manipulate the choice of external commands or their parameters, the attacker may be able to use this functionality to execute arbitrary commands. If an attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands, he is typically able to take over the application and possibly take over the entire system. </li>
<li> <a href="https://vulnerabilities.teammentor.net/article/26cf3a5c-3bbd-4239-b74f-f776df950ac8">LDAP Injection</a> - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a widely used protocol for accessing directory services. Directories provide a set of attributes about people that are organized in a hierarchical manner. LDAP Injection is a technique to exploit applications that use input from users to query an LDAP directory. LDAP injection has the potential to view, modify, or remove personal information about anyone in the directory.</li>
<li> <a href="https://vulnerabilities.teammentor.net/article/61db0098-48cc-4d33-9441-315b800b0647">XML Injection</a> - XML injection occurs when an attacker is able to supply data to the application that is interpreted as a part of an XML document in a manner that violates the intended use of XML by the application. XML injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is allowed to be concatenated with XML data. Concatenating the attacker's data with XML allows the attacker to manipulate the syntax and the contents of the XML document and thus allows the attacker to modify the behavior of the application.</li>
<li> <a href="https://vulnerabilities.teammentor.net/article/937f2173-5e39-48b6-bb3a-ecfd8f052bb0">Cross-Site Scripting</a> - A web application's output is rendered as a web page. If user input is included in the web application output, then it is also rendered as a part of the web page. If user input is included in output without being validated and encoded, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability results. In that case, an attacker can modify the output web page to include malicious script, which is then executed by the browser that views the vulnerable page.</li>
<li> <a href="https://vulnerabilities.teammentor.net/article/36d0c6a6-8a5c-4586-b0d5-917a9aff9557">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a> - A cross site request forgery (CSRF) attack occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into loading a page that contains a malicious request. This request may be able to change the state of the web application, and is possible because the request is sent in the context of the logged in victim. For many sites, each request automatically sends the victim's credentials, such as the session cookie or authentication credentials. Due to this fact, there is no way to distinguish the false request from a legitimate request. CSRF vulnerabilities affect web applications that allow authenticated users to perform operations that are not available to guest users.</li>
<li> <a href="https://vulnerabilities.teammentor.net/article/de524f32-c3f0-452d-ba89-b6044a03a4e8">Shell Upload</a> - File upload vulnerabilities allow attackers to upload malicious code. (Technically, allowing users to upload anything that the application's design doesn't account for can be considered a file upload vulnerability. In practice, real file upload vulnerabilities are those that allow attackers to upload and execute malicious code.)</li>
