<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.2.2</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Save the PCI DSS-compliant router configurations as the default start-up settings. Protect the configuration settings by setting the administrator password.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If changes were made to the router configuration but were not saved in the router configuration files, then these changes will be lost after the router is powered off or reset. If the changes to the router configuration are lost, then the router may revert
 to an earlier, insecure state.</p>
  <p>The router settings should be protected to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Refer to the vendor's documentation or tech support for detailed instructions on how to sync the current configuration with the start-up settings on your hardware. This should be very simple. Most routers configured with a web interface feature a button
 that saves the current settings as the start-up configuration, and some do it automatically when new settings are applied. This rule is really for routers configured using terminal commands, which may require a special command to save the current settings.
 Cisco IOS command for this is "copy running-configuration startup-configuration" or "copy run start." Most routers that use web administration interfaces save the configuration as the start-up settings automatically. Configure each router's access control settings to prevent unauthorized access to configuration settings - this is usually done by setting the administrator password.</p>
