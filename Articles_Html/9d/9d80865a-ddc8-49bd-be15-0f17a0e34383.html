  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Force users to renew their passwords after a given period of time.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Forcing users to renew their passwords reduces the risk of valid credentials becoming exposed. This technique can prevent attackers from obtaining valid credentials through the use of a Credentials Brute Force Attack or a Credentials Dictionary Attack. It can also reduce the business risk associated with any instances of discovered or leaked valid credentials.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Always force users to change their passwords after a given time period.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to force users to change their passwords:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define a password change policy.&nbsp;</strong>Establish a maximum password age for your application's users. For example, require that users must change passwords every 60 days and privileged users must change passwords every 30 days.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Design a password change mechanism.&nbsp;</strong>Track the password age, and prompt the user to change their password when the password expires. For example, the following SQL transaction will help the application to determine whether a user's password has expired:</p>
      <pre>sql&gt; select * from passHistory<br />      where userid = {{username}} and<br />            last_changed </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce the password change policy.&nbsp;</strong>Embed the change of password mechanism into the authentication routine. The routine should check if the current user is logged in, and if the password has not been changed since a long interval, the user should be forced to change the&nbsp;password.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;PCI DSS requirements state that a user's password must be renewed at most every 90 days and that the new password cannot be the same as the previous four.</p>
