  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that session IDs are protected.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Protecting session IDs helps protect user sessions from being hijacked.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that session IDs are protected:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Log in to the web site.</strong>&nbsp;Authenticate as a user to the web application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine the session cookie.</strong>&nbsp;Examine the cookies stored on the browser. Find the session cookie. Verify that it has the "<em>secure</em>" and&nbsp;"<em>HTTPOnly</em>"&nbsp;flags set to true.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that session IDs are not disclosed.</strong>&nbsp;Examine logs, error messages, and hyperlinks to make sure that session IDs are not disclosed in them.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p />
  <p>To protect session IDs:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Store session IDs in cookies.</strong>&nbsp;This is the default behavior in most Scala&nbsp;applications. Cookies have to be turned on for this to work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set the "<em>secure</em>" flag on session cookies.</strong>&nbsp;This is the default behavior in most Scala&nbsp;applications. SSL has to be turned on for this to work.&nbsp;Enable the Secure flag on the cookie using “application.session.secure=true” in the “application.conf” file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set the "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag on session cookies.</strong> Enable the HTTPOnly flag using “application.session.httpOnly=true” in the “application.conf” file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Do not disclose session IDs.</strong>&nbsp;Make sure that session IDs are not disclosed in URLs, logs, or error messages. Do not allow URL rewriting of session cookies.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
