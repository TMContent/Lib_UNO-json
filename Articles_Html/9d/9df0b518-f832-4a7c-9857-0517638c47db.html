<h2>Applies To</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java Servlets</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Do not make security decisions based on parameters that are sent by the client. Using client-accessible data to make security decisions allows the users to access and modify it. Therefore, an attacker would be able to bypass security measures.</p>
<h2>Problem Example</h2>
<p>The following code illustrates a servlet that accepts user-supplied input. Unfortunately, the application obtains the user's ID from the client which allows an attacker to tamper with data that influences security decisions.</p>
<pre><code>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
      HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException{
      String userID = request.getParameter(&quot;userid&quot;);
       ...
 }
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution Example</h2>
<p>The following code illustrates a servlet that accepts user-supplied input. Because the application obtains the user's ID from the user's session, it is not possible for an attacker to tamper with such data.</p>
<pre><code>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
      HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException{
      Session sess = request.getSession();
      String userID = (String)sess.getAttribute(&quot;userid&quot;);

      ...

}
</code></pre>
