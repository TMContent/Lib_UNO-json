  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>If you need to streamline certificate distribution to your clients, consider negotiating the service credentials.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Consider enabling negotiateServiceCredential if you need to streamline certificate distribution to your clients for message encryption. This option is only available with wsHttpbinding. Keep in mind that non-Microsoft clients will not be able to consume your service if you enable this option. Also consider that there is a performance penalty of negotiating credentials, due to messages exchange. Additionally, consider that allowing negotiation of service credentials is less secure, allowing any client to consume your service.</p>
  <p>The following binding configuration shows how to set this option:</p>
  <pre>&lt;binding name="BindingMessage"&gt;<br />   &lt;security mode="Message"&gt;<br />      &lt;message clientCredentialType="Windows" negotiateServiceCredential="true" /&gt;<br />   &lt;/security&gt;<br />&lt;/binding&gt;<br /></pre>
