  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that badge readers or other devices, such as lock and key, are used to secure the doors to each cardholder data environment. Check that idle computer terminals require a password to unlock. Ensure that video cameras or other mechanisms are in place
 to monitor the entry and exit points to sensitive areas. Check that video cameras or other surveillance devices&amp;nbsp;are protected from tampering. Verify that the recorded video is monitored and kept for at least three months. Check that physical network jacks
 are disabled unless in use. Ensure that visitors are escorted. Check&amp;nbsp;that wireless devices, such as routers and handhelds,&amp;nbsp;are physically secured.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Physical security should be in place to ensure that information storage media containing sensitive information cannot be physically accessed and easily stolen. Locking idle terminals ensures that a passer-by cannot gain unauthorized access. Securing physical
 network jacks ensures that an attacker cannot install rogue network devices. Wireless devices should be physically secured to prevent tampering with wireless settings or otherwise gaining unauthorized access to the network.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to verify if the required physical security controls are in place:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine the doors.</strong> Examine the doors of the the cardholder data environment(s) to verify that a card-reader, lock or other similar technology is used to secure each one.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine the identification badges. </strong>Verify that there are at least two different types of badges - badges for employees and badges for visitors. The employee and visitor badges should be noticeably different.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine the workstation terminals. </strong>Ask an administrator to access an idle terminal to verify that idle terminals require a password to activate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine the&amp;nbsp;cameras.</strong> Visit the camera-monitoring center to verify that video feeds are being watched, and the recorded video is stored for at least three months. Examine the video cameras to make sure that they are mounted in a way that
 prevents tampering.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine the network jacks.</strong> Examine the physical network jacks to verify that those not in use are not active.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that visitors are escorted.</strong> Interview staff to make sure that visitors are escorted when inside the facility.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine the wireless devices. </strong>Get a list of all the wireless network devices if available. Verify that all wireless network devices are physically secure by examining them.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following tasks to install the&amp;nbsp;security controls required by PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Lock the doors.</strong> Install locks on all entry and exit points to the cardholder data environment. The locks may be operated by cards, keys, fingerprint readers, or other mechanisms. Lock the doors when they are not in use.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Deploy identification badges.</strong> Acquire a badge management system. A badge management system typically includes card-readers, a card-issuing device, and a card-management application. Deploy the badge management system by following the vendor's
 instructions. Most card-management interfaces implement access control. Implement software access control by following the vendor's instructions. It may be a good idea to physically secure the computer, which has the card-management application installed,
 and the badge-issuing equipment, by locking them in a separate room. Allow only authorized staff to access the badge-management application and badge-issuing equipment. Design at least two types of badges, one to be issued to visitors and the other to be used
 by employees. Issue badges to visitors when their access is authorized. Instruct visitors to display their badges prominently when inside the facility. Ask visitors to return their badges when they are leaving the facility.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the workstation terminals.</strong> Configure workstations to lock after being idle for 15 minutes or less. For instructions on how to enforce automatic terminal locking policy, please see the guidance article called "Implement the Password
 Policy Using Group Policy Objects," linked at the bottom of this page. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Deploy video cameras.</strong> Install video cameras to monitor all the entries and exits to the facility. Install additional cameras as you deem necessary. Physically secure the cameras to prevent tampering by installing them in a way that makes
 it difficult to move them or obstruct their view. Wire the cameras to feed the video to a surveillance center. Acquire, install, and configure additional equipment as necessary to make it possible to view and record all camera feeds.Such additional equipment
 may include monitors, computers, storage media, and analog or digital video recorders. Hire or designate someone to watch and review the camera feeds. Instruct the security guard about the available technology and adequate responses as appropriate for your
 environment. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the network jacks.</strong> Identify all the physical network jacks. Identify all the network jacks that are not used. Disconnect all the unused network jacks from the network. There is typically a room where the wires from all the network
 jacks are hooked up to a switch. Unplug the wires that correspond to the unused jacks from the switch.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Escort the visitors.</strong> Instruct the receptionist and the employees to not allow any visitors to move about the facility without an escort.It may be prudent to have the employee who authorized the visitor's access to escort the visitor. Another,
 less practical option, may be to have a security guard escort the visitor. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the wireless devices.</strong> Identify all the wireless network devices. Place all the wireless routers in a locked room. Place all the portable wireless devices where it is difficult to steal them, such as in rooms not accessible to visitors
 or else directly in the users' possession.</p>
