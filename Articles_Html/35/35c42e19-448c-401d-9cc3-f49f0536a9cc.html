<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Store state information and sensitive data on the server side only. Ensure that the system definitively and unambiguously keeps track of its own state and user state and has rules defined for legitimate state transitions. Do not allow any application user
 to affect state directly in any way other than through legitimate actions leading to state transitions.</p>
