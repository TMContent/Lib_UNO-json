</ul><h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that TLS is used to protect Web Service connections.
</p><h2>Why</h2><p>Protect Web Service connections using TLS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
</p><h2>How to Check</h2><p>To verify that TLS is used to protect Web Service connections:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Make sure that valid certificates are present.</strong> Examine the certificates that are present on the server that is hosting the Web Services. Make sure that the certificates are valid for that server.</li>
<li> <strong>Verify that TLS is configured on the server.</strong> Examine the configuration of the server that is hosting the Web Services and make sure that Web Services are setup to only be acceptable over TLS encrypted connections.</li>
<li> <strong>Verify that client code connects to Web Services using TLS.</strong> Examine the client-side code of the application that uses the Web Services. Make sure that the application only uses TLS protected connections to connect to the Web Services.</li>
</ol><h2>How to Fix</h2><p>To use TLS to protect Web Service connections:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Get valid certificates.</strong> Provision valid certificates for the server hosting the Web Services.</li>
<li> <strong>Set up TLS on the server.</strong> Configure the server to use TLS for the Web Services. Don't allow unencrypted connections to the Web Services â€“ don't bind Web Services to ports that don't use TLS.</li>
<li> <strong>Update client code to use TLS.</strong> Change client code to connect to the Web Services using the port that uses TLS.</li>
