<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that when deploying your application in a Web farm, the same machine keys are used consistently across all servers.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>If you deploy your application in a Web farm, you must ensure that the configuration files on each server share hashing and encryption keys. These are used by ASP.NET to protect ViewState and forms authentication tickets. Manually generated, common keys are required because you cannot guarantee which server will handle successive requests.</p>
  <p>With manually generated key values, the &lt;<b>machineKey</b>&gt; settings should be similar to the following example.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;machineKey validationKey="21F090935F6E49C2C797F69BBAAD8402ABD2EE0B667A8B4<br />             4EA7DD4374267A75D7AD972A119482D15A4127461DB1DC347C1A63AE5F1CCFAACFF1B72A7F0A281B"<br />             decryptionKey="261F793EB53B761503AC445E0CA28DA44AA9B3CF06263B77"<br />             decryption="3DES"<br />             validation="SHA1" /&gt;</pre>
