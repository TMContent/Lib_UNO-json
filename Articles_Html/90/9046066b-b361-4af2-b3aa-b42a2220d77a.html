<h2>What to Check For</h2><p>Verify that authentication is required for all users.
</p>
<h2>Why</h2><p>Require authentication for all users to prevent unauthorized access. If a user account is not protected with at least a password, an attacker will be able to easily use that account.
</p>
<h2>How to Check</h2><p>To verify that authentication is required for all users:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify authentication code.</strong> Make a spreadsheet about the code that implements authentication in the application.</li>
<li> <strong>Make sure authentication is required for all users.</strong> Examine authentication code to verify that all user accounts require at least a password to login. Check for any special hard-coded user accounts that might not need credentials to login. These types of accounts should not be present.</li>
</ol><h2>How to Fix</h2><p>To force authentication for all users:
</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify authentication code.</strong> Make a spreadsheet about the code that implements authentication in the application.</li>
<li> <strong>Require authentication for all users.</strong> If it doesn't already require authentication for all users, modify authentication code so that at least a password is required for successful authentication for all users. Remove code that implements any special hard-coded user accounts that don't require authentication.</li>
