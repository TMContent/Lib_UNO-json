<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Replace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments, such as
<i>strcpy</i> with <i>strncpy</i>. Create these if they are not available. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This approach is still susceptible to calculation errors, including issues such as off-by-one errors (CWE-193) and incorrect calculation of buffer lengths (CWE-131). Additionally, this only addresses potential overflow issues. Resource
 consumption / exhaustion issues are still possible.</p>
