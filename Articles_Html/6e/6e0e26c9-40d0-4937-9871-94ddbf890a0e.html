<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.</p>
  <p>An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because
 the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.</p>
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>While much of the power of the World Wide Web is in sharing and following links between web sites, typically there is an assumption that a user should be able to click on a link or perform some other action before being sent to a different web site. Many
 web applications have implemented redirect features that allow attackers to specify an arbitrary URL to link to, and the web client does this automatically. This may be another of those features that are "just the way the web works," but if left unchecked,
 it could be useful to attackers in a couple of important ways. First, the victim could be autoamtically redirected to a malicious site that tries to attack the victim through the web browser. Alternately, a phishing attack could be conducted, which tricks
 victims into visiting malicious sites that are posing as legitimate sites. Either way, an uncontrolled redirect will send your users someplace that they don't want to go.</p>
  <h2>Detection</h2>
  <p>The following methods for detecting open redirect vulnerabilities are available:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Manual Static Analysis.</strong> Since this weakness does not typically appear frequently within a single software package, manual white box techniques may be able to provide sufficient code coverage and reduction of false positives if all potentially-vulnerable
 operations can be assessed within limited time constraints.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Automated Dynamic Analysis.</strong> Automated black box tools that supply URLs to every input may be able to spot Location header modifications, but test case coverage is a factor, and custom redirects may not be detected.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Automated Static Analysis.</strong> Automated static analysis tools may not be able to determine whether input influences the beginning of a URL, which is important for reducing false positives.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.</p>
  <h2>Mitigation</h2>
  <p>The following mitigation methods for open redirect vulnerabilities are available:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Assume all input is malicious.</strong> Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or
 transform it into something that does. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that
 they should be rejected outright.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate input from multiple perspectives.</strong> When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency
 across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if you are expecting colors such as "red" or "blue."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use white-list input validation.</strong> Use a whitelist of approved URLs or domains to be used for redirection.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Notify the user about redirection.</strong> Use an intermediate disclaimer page that provides the user with a clear warning that they are leaving your site. Implement a long timeout before the redirect occurs, or force the user to click on the link.
 Be careful to avoid XSS problems (CWE-79) when generating the disclaimer page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use reference maps.</strong> When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.
 For example, ID 1 could map to <em>"/login.asp</em>" and ID 2 could map to "<a href="http://www.example.com/"><em>http://www.example.com/</em></a>". Features such as the
<em>ESAPI AccessReferenceMap</em> provide this capability.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all sources of input.</strong> Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results,
 request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls. Many open redirect problems occur because the programmer
 assumed that certain inputs could not be modified, such as cookies and hidden form fields.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>(Optional) Use a web application firewall.</strong> Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency
 prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.
<br /><strong>Note:</strong> An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that
 receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.</p>
