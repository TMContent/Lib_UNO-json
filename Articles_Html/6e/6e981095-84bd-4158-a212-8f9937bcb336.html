  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Ensure that your code does not rely on client-side validation for security purposes.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Client side validation can be easily bypassed. For example, a malicious user could disable&nbsp;the client-side script routines by disabling JavaScript. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>During implementation, ensure all input from&nbsp;the client is&nbsp;validated, even if the input is not stored.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Do not rely on client-side validation because it can be easily bypassed. While you may have control over the source code for the clients that call your service, clients can be reverse engineered or built from scratch to attack your service.&nbsp; Use client-side validation to reduce round trips to the server and to improve the user experience, but always use validation in the service itself to perform security checks.</p>
