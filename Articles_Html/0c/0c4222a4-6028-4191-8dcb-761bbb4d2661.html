  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Set the "S<em>ecure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags on all sensitive cookies.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Set the "<em>Secure</em>" flag on all sensitive cookies to protect the contents of the sensitive cookies from eavesdropping attacks. Setting the "<em>Secure</em>" flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured by SSL. The "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script. This helps reduce the risk of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To set the "<em>Secure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags on all sensitive cookies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that SSL is available.</strong>&nbsp;The "<em>Secure</em>" flag forces cookies to be sent over SSL. SSL has to be available for this to work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive cookies.</strong>&nbsp;Session cookies should always be considered sensitive. Enumerate all cookies used by the application. Make a list of cookies that may contain sensitive information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify code that creates sensitive cookies.&nbsp;</strong>For each sensitive cookie in the list, find the code that creates that cookie.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set the "S<em>ecure</em>" and "<em>HTTPOnly</em>" flags for each sensitive cookie.</strong>&nbsp; Enable the HTTPOnly flag using “application.session.httpOnly=true” in the “application.conf” file. Enable the Secure flag on the cookie using “application.session.secure=true” in the “application.conf” file.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
