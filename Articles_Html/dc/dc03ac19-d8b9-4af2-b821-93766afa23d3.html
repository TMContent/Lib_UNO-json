  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that authentication is performed on the server.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Perform authentication on the server to make it harder for an attacker to bypass authentication controls. It is trivial to bypass client-side web authentication because the user can edit client-side scripts.</p>
  <h1>How To Check</h1>
  <p>To make sure that authentication is performed on the server, make sure that forms authentication is being used. You can determine whether forms authentication is being used by searching <em>Web.config</em> files for the following string:</p>
  <pre>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;</pre>
  <p>It is a good idea to review application code to make sure it takes full advantage of forms authentication.</p>
  <h1>How To Fix</h1>
  <p>To use forms authentication, enable and configure the following section in <em>Web.config</em>:</p>
  <pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &lt;/authentication&gt;<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;</pre>
