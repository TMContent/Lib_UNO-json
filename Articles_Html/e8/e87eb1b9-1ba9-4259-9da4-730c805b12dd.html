  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that logging is enabled and audited for unusual traffic or patterns when configuring your network routers.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>By default, a router logs all deny actions; this default behavior should not be changed. Also secure log files in a central location. Modern routers have an array of logging features that include the ability to set severities based on the data logged. An&nbsp;auditing schedule should be established to routinely inspect logs for signs of intrusion and probing.</p>
