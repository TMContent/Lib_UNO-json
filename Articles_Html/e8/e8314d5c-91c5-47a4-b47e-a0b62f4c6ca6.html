<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.3.6</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The Internet firewall should have dynamic packet filtering enabled. Dynamic packet filtering is also known as stateful inspection.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Dynamic packet filtering makes sure that only packets that are parts of an actual transmission can pass through the firewall. Dynamic packet filtering prevents a potential attacker from sending custom packets to scan the network or performing network layer
 attacks.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the firewall configuration to make sure that dynamic packet filtering is enabled.&nbsp;Use a port scanner, like nmap, to perform a syn-ack or a syn-rst port scan on the network devices in the DMZ from the Internet to make sure that such packets cannot get
 through the firewall.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Enable dynamic packet filtering on the Internet firewall. Refer to the firewall vendor's documentation or tech support for detailed instructions on enabling dynamic packet filtering on your firewall.</p>
