<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 8.5.13</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Lock user accounts if someone tries to guess passwords for them more than six times.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Locking the terminal after repeated failed authentication attempts ensures that an attacker cannot guess the password in a timely manner.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that user accounts are locked after six failed logon attempts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this
 page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Edit or create a Group Policy Object (GPO). </strong>To create and activate a new Group Policy Object (GPO), launch "The Group Policy Management" console, right click on the domain and select "Create and Link a GPO Here." To edit an existing GPO,

    </li>
    <li>
