<h1>Applies to</h1><p>Scala and Play Framework 2.1.0+
</p><h1>What to Check For</h1><p>Ensure your application displays a generic message when authentication fails.
</p><h1>Why</h1><p>Disclosing information about invalid usernames and passwords can help an 
attacker obtain a list of valid users.
</p><h1>How to Check</h1><p>To ensure that your application displays generic messages upon failed 
authentication:</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Identify all segments of code that handle failed authentication.</strong> Identify all 
functions that handle login and perform access control on resources. Trace your 
application's code base to locate the origin of each failed authentication 
message. Good places to start are if-else statements, throw statements and 
exception handlers. It is a common practice for developers to group messages 
into resource files instead of hard-coding them into your application's source 
code</li>
<li> <strong>Review the error messages.</strong> Review the returned error messages. Verify that:</li>
</ol><ul><li>Structure: Error messages are brief and direct.</li>
<li>Contents: Error messages do not contain unnecessary contents such as internal debug information.</li>
<li>Variety: All error messages that pertain to failed authentication are identical.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to Fix</h1><p>To provide secure error messages when authentication fails, use the following 
steps:</p><ol>
<li> <strong>Choose an error message.</strong> The message should be very generic. It should 
signify "yes" or "no" to the authentication attempt. For example: "Authentication 
failed."</li>
<li> <strong>Display only one message.</strong> Your application should provide feedback only 
after all credentials have been verified. Structure your code in a manner that 
allows all checks to be executed at once. For example:</li>
</ol><pre>           if (!validUser() || !validPass()) 
              { 
                throw new AuthenticationException("Authentication failed."); 
               }
</pre>
<p>
Because it is sometimes impossible to structure the code in a manner where all 
checks are performed at once, it is important that all error messages contain the 
exact same information. Any variation in the error messages can give away the 
information that a username is valid.
