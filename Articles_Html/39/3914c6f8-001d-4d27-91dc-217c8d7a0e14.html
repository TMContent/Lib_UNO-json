  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Log visitor information and store it for at least three months. Log the visitors' names, the firms represented, and the names of the employees authorizing access.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Visitor information should be logged to assist with an audit if needed. In the event of a compromise, the list of visitors provides a list of suspects.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Start a visitor's log, recording the following information for each visitor: the visitor's name, the firm represented, and the name of the employee authorizing access. One way of keeping a visitor log is to make a spreadsheet with columns for the required
 information, print it out, give it to the receptionist, and ask visitors to fill it out before granting them access.</p>
