          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* ASP.NET 4.0\r\n\r\n==What to Do==\r\n\r\nUse parameterized APIs to build XML documents instead of treating XML documents as strings and concatenating data into them.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nAPIs that are designed for building XML documents will encode data properly to prevent attackers from manipulating XML data used by your application. A dangerous approach is to write your own set of functions to build XML documents by concatenating strings, or to modify an existing XML document by performing string operations. This means you have to take care of proper encoding yourself. Use APIs because they are simpler and safer.\r\n\r\n==How==\r\n\r\nTo use parameterized APIs to build XML documents:\r\n\r\n# **Identify available APIs that can be used to build XML documents.** ASP.NET provides comprehensive APIs for building XML documents, namely the XmlDocument class and the entire System.Xml namespace.\r\n# **Identify code that builds XML documents.** Make a spreadsheet of all the code that creates XML documents.\r\n# **Use parameterized APIs to build XML documents.** Update all code that builds XML documents to use the XmlDocument class and other classes from the System.Xml namespace to build XML documents. Make sure that your application never builds XML documents by using string operations.\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For more information about the XmlDocument calss, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmldocument%28v=vs.110%29.aspx\r\n"
