          "===What to Do==\n\nVerify that inactive terminal sessions are locked after being idle for at most 15 minutes.\n\n\n==Why==\n\nLocking inactive terminal sessions ensures that a passerby cannot use the credentials of the user who is currently logged in.\n\n\n==How to Check==\n\nFor web applications, examine the configuration of the platform that the application is deployed on to make sure that it is configured to expire idle sessions after at most 15 minutes of inactivity and make sure that the application uses the framework-provided session management.\n\nFor all other applications, leave the terminal idle for 15 minutes to make sure that it gets locked by the operating system.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nWeb Applications should use session management provided by the framework to expire inactive user sessions after 15 minutes of inactivity. The procedure for this is different for different platforms, but it is always well documented. Follow the documentation provided by your platform's vendor to set the idle session expiration period using built-in session management.\n\nAll other applications should rely on the operating system being configured to lock the terminal after 15 minutes of inactivity. It is not the responsibility of the developers to lock the idle terminal."
