          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* HTML5\r\n* Server-side\r\n\r\n==What to Do==\r\n\r\nForce the user to re-authenticate when executing security-critical functionality including, but not limited to, change of password, account modifications and critical transactions.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nForcing the user to re-authenticate verifies the user's decision to execute the given functionality and preserves the application's integrity in the event that a user's account has been compromised via session hijacking.\r\n\r\n==How==\r\n\r\nFollow these steps when forcing re-authentication:\r\n\r\n# **Identify critical functionality.** Evaluate your application's design and requirements to determine which parts and resources of your application are very important to your organization's business model or your application's security architecture. This could include activities such as financial transactions or resetting user passwords.\r\n# **Adopt a re-authentication mechanism.** Establish a mechanism that requires the user to verify their authenticity:\r\n## **Current password.** The user uses their current password to confirm their identity. This technique ensures that the user is aware of the action to be performed and holds responsibility for executing it. \r\n## **CAPTCHA.** CAPTCHA are mechanisms designed to ensure that a human, not an automated script, is using the system. A CAPTCHA should be used in addition to, not instead of, a password. Many CAPTCHA systems embed distorted letters or numbers into displayed images, and require the user to enter the letters or numbers. There are a number of problems with many CAPTCHA systems, so don't rely on them too heavily. Many graphical CAPTCHAs can be trivially broken by optical character recognition systems, so it is difficult to ensure that a CAPTCHA is sufficiently strong. If CAPTCHAs are reused, the attacker can simply record the session IDs of CAPTCHAs with known values and replay them. CAPTCHAs can also be broken by using a man-in-the-middle technique where the image is saved and forwarded to another site controlled by the attacker. An unsuspecting user of that site solves the CAPTCHA and the attacker forwards the answer to the victim site. CAPTCHAs also create accessibility problems for users, as blind and sometimes even color-blind individuals can find them impossible. If you choose to implement a CAPTCHA, be aware of the trade-offs involved and ensure that the system you use is appropriately protected against any anticipated attacks.\r\n## **Second factor.** If your application supports it, then a second factor of authentication, such as a token, could play a role in the re-authentication scheme.\r\n# **Enforce the re-authentication mechanism.** Once you've identified the critical functionality and established the re-authentication mechanism, enforce the re-authentication mechanism before permitting any security-critical actions.\r\n\r\n==Essential Server-side Security Guidelines==\r\n\r\n* [[e2c5d605-2b34-4e1c-80aa-211a0ad7b64f|Validate All Input]]\r\n* [[397488da-ce91-4768-9ad9-1e6928980d72|Use Prepared Statements for SQL Queries]]\r\n* [[496b6306-dca6-48b6-920e-67e768dbe334|Encode Input Included in Output]]\r\n* [[45d61f0a-c4d3-44f0-93b1-d8205cd13fbe|Force Reauthentication when Executing Critical Functionality]]\r\n* [[fdb460e6-5d18-4e35-a093-4b260155d79e|Include Unique Tokens in HTTP Requests]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000007ecacc|Use Role-based Authorization]]\r\n* [[1445abaf-4bb9-474c-b7e4-7bf58fe80f39|URL-Encode Data in HTTP Response Headers]]\r\n\r\n==Essential Server-side Security Checklist Items==\r\n\r\n* [[8dfa8088-a6cb-4062-8a44-0df8f2bc1cc4|All Input Is Validated]]\r\n* [[b5fb44c5-1702-42cf-b6be-894c511af7ac|Prepared Statements Are Used for SQL Queries]]\r\n* [[0ee9bc9f-c363-4a2d-be89-f84c069bda65|Input Included in Output Is Encoded]]\r\n* [[1c2b0859-c898-4f1c-b826-21392a7fc773|Reauthentication Is Enforced When Executing Critical Functionality]]\r\n* [[a2ef2a76-e562-4dd0-af9e-a6eb2b76c0d3|Unique Tokens Are Included in HTTP Requests]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008495ec|Role-based Authorization Is Used]]\r\n* [[3eb26600-9126-493a-a3cf-9d4b9815efc9|Data in HTTP Response Headers Is URL-Encoded]]"
