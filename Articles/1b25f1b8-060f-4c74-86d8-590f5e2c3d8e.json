Ideally, exceptions should be caught close to the source, because then it is easier to write error messages that improve the user experience and provide useful debugging information.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nUse structured exception handling and catch exception conditions. Doing so avoids leaving your application in an inconsistent state that may lead to information disclosure. It also helps protect your application from denial of service attacks. Decide how to propagate exceptions internally in your application and give special consideration to what occurs at the application boundary.\r\n\r\n"
