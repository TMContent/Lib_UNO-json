          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* ASP.NET\r\n\r\n==What to Do==\r\n\r\nSet //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags on session cookies.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nThe //Secure// flag should be set on session cookie to protect its contents from eavesdropping attacks.  These attacks, if successful, can be used to hijack the userâ€™s session and interact with the application as if they were the real user. Setting the //Secure// flag on session cookie ensures it is only transferred over connections that are secured by SSL and prevents eavesdropping.\r\n\r\nThe //HTTPOnly// flag should be set on session cookie to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Setting the //HTTPOnly// flag on session cookie prevents the contents of the cookie from being transmitted by a client-side script. Since in a Cross-Site Scripting attack  an arbitrary script runs in the context of the user's browser, the //HTTPOnly// flag effectively prevents the malicious script from using the cookie in the attack.\r\n\r\n==How==\r\n\r\nTo set //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags on session cookies:\r\n\r\n# **Configure IIS to use SSL/TLS.** Get a valid certificate. Hosting service providers often sell valid SSL certificates. Install the certificate. Create an HTTPS binding for the site. A link in the \"Additional Resources\" section describes how to do this in detail.\r\n# **Set the Secure and HTTPOnly flags for session cookies.** Edit the Web.config file. Set the //httpOnlyCookies// property to //true// for the //httpCookies// element. Set the //requireSSL// property to //true// for the //httpCookies// element. There are different ways to write this in XML. Here is one: <httpcookies httponlycookies=\"true\" requiressl=\"true\"></httpcookies>\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For information about setting up SSL on IIS, see http://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis"
