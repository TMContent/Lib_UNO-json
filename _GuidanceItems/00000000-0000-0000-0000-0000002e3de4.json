          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* All iOS applications.\r\n\r\n==What to Do==\r\n\r\nImplement code integrity checks that are difficult to bypass.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nCode integrity checks help prevent software piracy and unauthorized modifications to the application. Code integrity checks do not provide 100% assurance of code integrity, but they make it harder for an attacker to modify the application binary code without breaking it.\r\n\r\n==How==\r\n\r\nTo check code for integrity:\r\n\r\n# **Write piracy check functions.** Piracy check functions often try to determine whether the application is running on a jailbroken device. The application is not necessarily pirated if it is on a jailbroken device, but there are no fool-proof anti-piracy or code integrity measures for jailbroken devices. Piracy checks can determine whether a device is jailbroken by looking for files that only appear on jailbroken devices, such as Cydia. If piracy is not a concern, this step may be omitted.\r\n# **Write integrity check functions.** The most common ways to implement code integrity checks is to check classes for expected addresses or checksums. The //class_getMethodImplementation// method returns a pointer to a method; checking the value of this pointer against the expected value provides reasonable assurance that the method has not been modified during runtime.\r\n# **Define integrity check functions as inline.** The integrity check functions written in the previous step should be defined as //inline// so that the compiler inserts the full integrity checking code wherever it is invoked.\r\n# **Scatter integrity check functions throughout the application.** Multiple integrity check function calls spread out throughout the application make it harder for an attacker to find them all and patch them.\r\n\r\n==Code Integrity Guidelines==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002e3de4|Implement Code Integrity Checks]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000470103|Sign iOS Application Updates]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000986af1|Sign iOS Applications]]\r\n\r\n==Code Integrity Checklists==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002d9dac|Code Integrity Checks Are Implemented]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000892dc7|iOS Application Updates Are Signed]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000039db6a|iOS Applications Are Signed]]\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For more information about the //class_getMethodImplementation// method, please see https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html"
