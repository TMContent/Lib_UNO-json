          "<h1>Description</h1>\r\n  <p>If you do not use delay-signing, use password-protected .pfx files to help protect your private key. Visual Studio&nbsp;includes support for .pfx files, which makes this very convenient. This approach is more appropriate for small- to medium-sized projects. If you previously shared or had access to .snk files that included a private key, you should use .pfx files instead (unless you use delay signing). </p>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>AssemblyKeyFileAttribute</b> has been deprecated in Visual Studio. You should use project properties or <b>/keyfile</b> instead.</blockquote>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
