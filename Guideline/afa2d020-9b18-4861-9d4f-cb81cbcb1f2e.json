Use role-based authorization policies.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>All pages that have private information should require authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized information disclosure. Use role-based authorization policies because they are relatively simple to manage correctly.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>To require authentication and authorization for all sensitive pages:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify all sensitive pages.</strong> Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive or private information.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Define roles.</strong> Define access roles for your application. These roles should include administrative users and various types of users specific to your application.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Use JAAS to implement authentication and role-based access control.</strong> Implementing authentication and authorization with JAAS is an involved process that has a significant impact on the application architecture. Please, follow the links at the bottom of this page to find out more about using JAAS. </p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <br />"
