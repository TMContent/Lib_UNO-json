If your service needs to access specific resources on behalf of the original caller, use impersonation and delegation to flow the caller&#8217;s identity for a downstream authorization check.</p>\r\n  <p>In a development scenario, use the local network service account, which is a special built-in account that has reduced privileges. In a production scenario, create a least-privileged custom domain service account. </p>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information on how to create a custom service account, see &#8220;How To - Create a Service Account for an ASP.NET 2.0 Application&#8221; at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998297.aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998297.aspx</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
