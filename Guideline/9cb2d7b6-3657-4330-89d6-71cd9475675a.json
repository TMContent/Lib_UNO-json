Some examples are: </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Repeated failed authentication attempts <li>Invalid logical access attempts <li>Failed password reset attempts <li>Suspicious financial transactions <li>Unauthorized data access <li>Suspicious database queries that may indicate SQL injection attempts</li></li></li></li></li></li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Identify relevant code.</strong> Use the list of unusual activity indicators to find code that implements the functionality for each unusual activity. Make a list of functions that implement the related functionality. One common area for detecting suspicious activity is authentication code.</p>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Identify the logging subsystem.</strong> The logging subsystem should provide an API that allows generating log entries from application code. If this API or the logging subsystems don't exist, write them. Make a list of functions that may be used to generate log entries and collect documentation about how to use them.</p>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Log unusual activity.</strong> Use the list of functions that are related to suspicious events from step 2 to add code that generates log entries when suspicious activity occurs. Use the list of logging APIs from step 3 to write code that generates log entries.</p>\r\n          </li>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>"
