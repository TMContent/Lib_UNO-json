          "=Description\n\nApplications use connection strings to specify credentials used to access databases. One way to handle connection strings is to hard-code them into the application. This approach is not secure, because anyone with access to the application code is able to recover these connection strings. Once an attacker has recovered the connection strings, he can use them to access the database(s). \n\n=Impact\n\nOnce the attacker has the database access credentials, he may be able to connect to the database and execute arbitrary queries. The privileges granted to the attacker will be based on the access level of the credentials. Typically, the attacker is then able to retrieve, modify, and delete any data in the database, and modify database structure. Having this level of control over the database usually allows the attacker to take full control of the application. If the attacker is able to leverage additional vulnerabilities, or if the servers are not configured securely, the attacker may also take full control of the application server and the database server.\n\n=Countermeasures\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, store connection strings in protected configuration files. \n\nStore connection strings in protected configuration files:\n\n* [[612e1d5c-8b41-43ef-a203-daa6f814c57b|Encrypt SQL Connection Strings with DPAPI]]\n* [[b42bbac5-7441-436a-92a5-a0d05593c62c|Encrypt SQL Connection Strings with RSA on Web Farms]]\n\n=Application Check\n\nTo check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, examine all code that uses the database and ensure that connections strings are stored in protected configuration files.\n\nConnection strings are stored in protected configuration files:\n\n* [[eb8d54d3-1d59-4d33-ba54-b69df5d2eb74|Connection Strings Are Encrypted]]\n\n=Computer Based Training Links=\n\nUse the following Computer Based Training course(s) for more background information about this type of vulnerabilities.\n\n==Creating Secure Code – .NET 4.0 Foundations==\n\nThis course describes .NET security features, including concepts such as Code Access Security (CAS) and .NET cryptographic technologies. It also provides secure coding best practices that will enable you to build more secure applications in .NET. \n\n[[https://teamprofessor.absorbtraining.com/ninja/#/courses/course/127611|COD 215 Creating Secure Code – .NET 4.0 Foundations]]\n\n==Creating Secure ASP.NET Code==\n\nThis in-depth course examines the development of secure Web applications in ASP.Net. It provides developers and testers with an overview of common Web application vulnerabilities and a set of nine best practices and techniques to follow in order to avoid them. Throughout the course, students are provided with interactive games and simulations designed to reinforce the secure design and coding concepts that were introduced.\n\n[[https://teamprofessor.absorbtraining.com/ninja/#/courses/course/127607|COD 311 Creating Secure ASP.NET Code]]\n\n//Valid login credentials and enrollment in the course itself are required to access Team Professor content.
