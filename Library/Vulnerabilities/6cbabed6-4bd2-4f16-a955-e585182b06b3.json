          "=Description\n\nCookies are used by web applications to store data in the browser. Cookies may be marked as persistent and stored for an extended period of time. An attacker may gain access to the drive that stores the cookies and recover sensitive data from them. The exact impact depends on the nature of the sensitive data in the cookies. This vulnerability applies to web applications that use cookies. \n\n=Impact\n\nThe exact impact of this vulnerability depends on the sensitive data stored in the cookies that the attacker has gained access to. Usually this is session data that keeps a user authenticated to an application. In that case, the attacker is able to impersonate the authenticated user. The ability to impersonate an authenticated user allows the attacker to carry out any actions that are available to that user within the application. That might be enough for the attacker, or he may use that access to leverage additional vulnerabilities for additional privileges. \n\n=Countermeasures\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, don't store sensitive data in persistent cookies. \n\nDon't store sensitive data in persistent cookies:\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004e3194|Do Not Store Sensitive Data in Persistent Cookies]]\n\n=Application Check\n\nTo check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, find all code that stores cookies and ensure that sensitive data is not stored in persistent cookies. \n\nSensitive data is not stored in persistent cookies:\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000152037|Sensitive Data Is Not Stored in Persistent Cookies]]\n\n=Computer Based Training Links=\n\nUse the following Computer Based Training course(s) to learn more about Information Leaks through Persistent Cookies including techniques for remediation and prevention.\n\n==Creating Secure PHP Code==\n\nThis course introduces best practices for developing secure PHP code. The course also identifies common PHP vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain access to critical information. In addition, the course explains mitigation techniques that you can use to avoid common PHP vulnerabilities and write secure code. After completing this course, you will be able to describe the best practices for developing secure PHP code, explain common PHP vulnerabilities and learn mitigation techniques to avoid common PHP vulnerabilities and write secure code. \n\n[[https://teamprofessor.absorbtraining.com/ninja/#/courses/course/127620|COD 315 Creating Secure PHP Code]].\n\n//Valid login credentials and enrollment in the course itself are required to access Team Professor content.
