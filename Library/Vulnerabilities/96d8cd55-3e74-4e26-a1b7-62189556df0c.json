          "=Description\r\n\r\nScripting languages often have functions, such as eval(), that allow interpreting a string or a file as a part of the application. The danger of using these functions is that under certain conditions an attacker may be able to supply malicious code and it will be executed as a part of the application. This gives the attacker full control of the application. Code injection vulnerabilities affect all scripting languages, but typically occur in web applications written in PHP. \r\n\r\n=Impact\r\n\r\nAn attacker gains full control of the application and the ability to use any operating system functions that are available to the scripting environment. Code injection is one of the most dangerous vulnerability types, if not the most dangerous. On top of being extremely powerful, code injection vulnerabilities are typically easy to exploit, especially in web applications. \r\n\r\n=Countermeasures\r\n\r\nTo prevent code injection vulnerabilities, validate all input and avoid using dangerous APIs.\r\n\r\nValidate all input:\r\n* [[3de41277-0cc1-4ebc-8dd7-e96d161aa0ef|Validate All Input]]\r\n* [[e59923e7-c2fb-4a75-8db7-a9a91e869f74|Validate Input for Length, Range, Format, And Type]]\r\n\r\nAvoid using dangerous APIs:\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000302a8f|Avoid Using Reflection]]\r\n\r\n=Application Check\r\n\r\nTo check for adequate protection against code injection, find all the calls to dangerous functions and verify that data passed to them is sufficiently validated, and ensure that dangerous APIs are avoided.\r\n\r\nAll input is validated:\r\n* [[a210fcb7-f142-4c2e-844a-c43e0859f90d|All Input Is Validated]]\r\n* [[0e71dd64-87d1-4cf5-9569-ea320f209977|Input Is Validated for Length, Range, Format, And Type]]\r\n\r\nDangerous APIs are avoided:\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000012cfad|Reflection Is Avoided]]\r\n\r\n=Computer Based Training Links=\r\n\r\nUse the following Computer Based Training course(s) for more background information about this type of vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n==OWASP Top Threats & Mitigations==\r\n\r\nThis course examines in depth the vulnerabilities, threats, and mitigations described in the OWASP Top 10 2013. Upon completion of this class, participants will be able to identify and mitigate the greatest threats that web application developers face, including: Injection, Broken Authentication and Session Management, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Insecure Direct Object References, Security Misconfiguration, Sensitive Data Exposure, Missing Function Level Access Control, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities, and Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards.\r\n\r\n[[https://teamprofessor.absorbtraining.com/ninja/#/courses/course/139631|DES 221 OWASP Top Threats & Mitigations]]\r\n\r\n//Valid login credentials and enrollment in the course itself are required to access Team Professor content.
