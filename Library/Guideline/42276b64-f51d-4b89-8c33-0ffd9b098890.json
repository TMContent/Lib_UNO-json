Most mature web application frameworks offer secure session management functionality.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>To use session management offered by the framework, please refer to the documentation for your chosen framework. Most Java frameworks take advantage of <em>HttpSession</em> objects.</p>"
