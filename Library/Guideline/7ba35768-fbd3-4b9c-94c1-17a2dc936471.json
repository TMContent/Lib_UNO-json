Log files should be archived regularly to ensure that they do not fill up or start to cycle, and they should be regularly analyzed to detect signs of intrusion. Also ensure that any accounts used to perform the backup are least privileged and that you secure any additional communication channels exposed purely for the purpose of the backup.</p>\n  <br />\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
