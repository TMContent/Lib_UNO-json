At the very least, there should be an administration panel for managing user accounts, and a page for users to manage their own accounts.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Make authentication and authorization code configurable.</strong> Find all code responsible for authentication and authorization features. Modify this code to read settings defined in the application requirements.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Design the administrative pages.</strong> Design the pages to be used for configuring access control and authentication policies based on the requirements for your application.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Implement the administration interface.</strong> Write code for the administrative pages to interface with authentication and authorization code. The administration interface should be able to read and write settings to a secure location, where the authentication and authorization code may access them. The saved settings should be protected with access controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure and tampering.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>For more information about ASP.NET role management, please see \"Understanding Role Management\" at <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5k850zwb.aspx\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5k850zwb.aspx</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
