If you are deploying a WCF service for a real-world production environment, use a certificate provided by a CA such as Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Certificate Server or a third party.</p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information on how to create a certificate, see &#8220;Certificate Creation Tool&#8221; at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bfsktky3(VS.80).aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bfsktky3(VS.80).aspx</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
