Additionally basicHttpbinding provides a wide range of authentication schemes. Transport security supports basic, digest, windows and certificate authentication; message security supports username and certificate authentication</p>\r\n  <h1>When</h1>\r\n  <p>If you have ASMX client base, consider using basicHttpBinding in your service, because it&nbsp; can be consumed by both WCF and legacy&nbsp;clients.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>To use basicHttpBinding, create an endpoint, with binding configuration to use basicHttBinding. Security mode is turned off by default. To enable security and authentication you will need to create a binding configuration and configure the endpoint to use it.</p>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
