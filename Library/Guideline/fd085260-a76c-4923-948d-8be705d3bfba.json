Transport Security is transport dependent and does not require that the communicating parties understand XML-level security concepts. This can improve the interoperability.</p>\r\n  <p>Consider that, if you are using transport security you cannot use Service Credential Negotiation or authentication types such as Username or Issue Token (CardSpace).</p>\r\n  <p>Use the following criteria to decide whether or not to use transport security:</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Point-to-point. Transport security supports point-to-point communication and does not support intermediary scenarios or protocol transition.\r\n<li>Streaming. Transport security can support streaming data scenarios.\r\n<li>Binding limitations. Transport security does not work with the wsDualHttpBinding.\r\n<li>Authentication limitations. Transport security does not work with negotiation, username, Issue Token (CardSpace)&nbsp; or Kerberos direct authentication<br /></li></li></li></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information on choosing a transport, see “Choosing a Transport”&nbsp; at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733769.aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733769.aspx</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
