The service metadata that a WCF service publishes contains a detailed description about the service and may intentionally or unintentionally contain sensitive information. For example, service metadata may contain information about infrastructure operations that was not intended to be broadcast publicly.</p>\n  <p>You can use any standard binding (which has security features) you want for the MEX service endpoint, the only requirement is to use the IMetadataExchange contract.</p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information on using the secure bindings see <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2006/08/31/733173.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2006/08/31/733173.aspx</a><li>For more information see “Security Considerations with Metadata” at <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734741.aspx\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734741.aspx</a></li></li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
