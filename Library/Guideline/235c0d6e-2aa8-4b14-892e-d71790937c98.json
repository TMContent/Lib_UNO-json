Avoid disclosing the location of the logs to users.</p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Set appropriate file permissions.</strong> Set the file system permissions so that only your application and its administrators/developers have access to its logs.</p>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Keep the logging framework away from users.</strong> Do not allow your application's users to interact directly with the logging framework. The logging framework should log information regarding the performance of the application but should avoid storing user-supplied data inside the logs. Some user-supplied information can aid an attacker into poisoning your application's logs. </p>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Consider using log rotation.</strong> Log rotation prevents your application from working with large log files. It allows you to manage and audit your application's logged events without interfering in your application's workings. Use the following steps when utilizing log rotation:</p>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <strong>Define a rotation period:</strong> Schedule your log rotation on a regular basis. For example, rotate your logs every Monday. </p>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    <strong>Create a new log file:</strong> Create a new log file when your application needs to rotate its log files. Major operating systems allow a file to only be appended to (not read or modified).</p>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <strong>Back up the existing log files:</strong> Back up the existing log files when your application needs to rotate its log files. Consult your internal auditing policy to determine the period for which logs should be backed up. If your application backs up its logs, store them into an environment that is as secure as the storage environment for the current logs. <br /><strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS requirements state that logs should be kept for at least one year. </p>\r\n                  </li>\r\n                </li>\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <p>\r\n                <strong>Consider using an external logging application.</strong> Using an external logging application ensures that your application's logs will be kept up-to-date even if your application abruptly terminates. Use a custom error handler that calls syslog to deliver error messages, configuring syslog securely. On windows, this goes to the event log.</p>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <strong>Consider encoding output that is sent to log files.</strong> This can be useful in preventing log forging. Stripping out certain characters &amp;#91;\\r\\n&amp;#93; that are known to create new lines, which can allow an attacker to forge log entries. </p>\r\n              </li>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </li>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information about protecting log files on Linux, see <a href=\"http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/424-how-to-protect-our-logs-fromtampering/\">http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/424-how-to-protect-our-logs-fromtampering/</a><li>For more information about protecting log files on BSD, see <a href=\"http://www.bsdguides.org/guides/freebsd/security/harden.php\">http://www.bsdguides.org/guides/freebsd/security/harden.php</a><li>For information about&amp;nbsp;the <em>set_error_handler</em> function, see&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php\">http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php</a><li>For information about the <em>syslog</em> function, see <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.syslog.php\">http://php.net/manual/en/function.syslog.php</a></li></li></li></li>\r\n  </ul>"
