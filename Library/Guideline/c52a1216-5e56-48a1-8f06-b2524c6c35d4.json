If sensitive data is cached on the client machine, it has serious security implications because it leaves interesting data available to attackers.<br />Perform the following steps to ensure that sensitive data is not cached:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>Review operations for sensitive data. Review all of your operations for usage of sensitive data. This could include but is not limited to:</li>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Information that either contains personally identifiable information (PII) or can be used to derive PII that should not be shared with users </li>\r\n      <li>Information that a user provides that they would not want shared with other users of the application </li>\r\n      <li>Information that comes from an external trusted source that is not designed to be shared with users </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <li>Review the operations for caching of sensitive data. Review how each operation manages sensitive data and ensure that it is not cached. There are three patterns of sensitive data caching that you can review for:</li>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Custom caching code such as use of a Dictionary or SortedList object</li>\r\n      <li>Use of the ASP.NET cache via System.Web.Caching.Cache.&nbsp;</li>\r\n      <li>Use of an Enterprise Library caching block<br /></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
