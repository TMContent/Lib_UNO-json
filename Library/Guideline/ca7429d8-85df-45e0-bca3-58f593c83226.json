If you need to send sensitive data between the client and WCF service, consider using message or transport security. If you need to protect server-to-server communication, such as between your WCF service and a Microsoft SQL Server&#174; database, consider Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) or SSL.</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
