Allocating a large enough buffer to fit data being copied is vital for preventing buffer overflows.</p>\r\n  <h1>When</h1>\r\n  <p>The amount of memory used by an array or a string should be calculated when copying data.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the sizeof() function to determine the size of an array. Do not pass a pointer as an argument to sizeof() when calculating the size of an array. When an array is passed to a function as a parameter, it is passed as a pointer. If that function then calls sizeof() using that pointer as an argument, sizeof() will return the size of the pointer, not the size of the array. To get the amount of memory used by an array or a string correctly, use sizeof() in the same scope in which the array or string is declared. Store the memory size of an array or a string as a variable and pass it as an argument to other functions when it is necessary to know the size of the array or string outside of the scope where it is declared.</p>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information about getting sizes of arrays correctly, please see \"ARR01-CPP.
