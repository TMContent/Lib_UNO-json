Authorize access only to highly trusted accounts such as administrators.</li>\n    <li>Restrict access to audit and log files using Windows ACLs. If you log events to SQL Server or to some custom event sink, use appropriate access controls to limit access to the event data. For example, grant write access to the account or accounts used by your application, grant full control to administrators, and read-only access to operators.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
