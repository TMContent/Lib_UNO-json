For example, the .xml file extension is not a safe choice. You can check the Internet Information Services (IIS) administration guide to see a list of extensions that can be served.<li>Specify an absolute path for the log file location, which should be outside of the Web host vroot public directory to prevent it from being accessed by an external party using a Web browser.</li></li></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>By default, when using message logging, keys and personally identifiable information (PII) username and password and application-specific headers, such as, query string; and body information, such as, a credit card number, are not logged in traces and logged messages. </p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information on protecting sensitive data in logs, see &#8220;Security Concerns for Message Logging&#8221; at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730318.aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730318.aspx</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
