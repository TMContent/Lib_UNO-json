Take time to design this library or class carefuly. Consider functionality to send logs to a remote log server. One of the most common protocols for interfacing with a remote log server is syslog (RFC 5424). Create and document an API for logging events with an adequate amount of information.</p>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Add code that logs important business operations.</strong> Use the list of functions that carry out important business operations and add code to each function to use the logging API to make records when important business operations take place.

Record success and failure indications.</p>\r\n          </li>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/7af4efea-59f5-468a-b5a1-c423cd29744a\">Centralize Logging</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
