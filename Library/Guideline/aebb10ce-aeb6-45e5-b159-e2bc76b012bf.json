Because the application is web-based, it is likely that the account is on the web server. </p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Identify the application's requirements. </strong>Determine what access rights are required by your application. Because the application may need access to different resources such as sockets and the local filesystem, identify the resources that are essential to your application's business logic. For example, identify the local directories that should be accessed. </p>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Set the appropriate privileges. </strong>Create a role for your application by dedicating a local group to it. Once the appropriate privileges are established, set the appropriate access rights to the local system account. Any extra privileges should be revoked.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Problem Example</h1>\r\n  <p>The following snippet shows the access rights associated with MyApp's local account as noted in the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file.
