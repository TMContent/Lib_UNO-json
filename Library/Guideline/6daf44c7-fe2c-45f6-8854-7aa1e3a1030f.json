This technique is often used by phishers to trick people into visiting fake sites that steal authentication credentials.</p>\n  <h1>When</h1>\n  <p>Use this guideline when writing a web application that uses redirects or forwards. Avoid using redirects or forwards in web applications, if possible.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Perform the following actions to calculate destinations of redirects and forwards without user input:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Find redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all pages that perform redirects or forwards. </p>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Identify dangerous redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all redirects and forwards that rely on user input to calculate their destinations.</p>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Rewrite redirects and forwards.</strong> Consider making design or code changes to get rid of each redirect or forward, if possible. If a redirect or forward is absolutely necessary, consider how it may be rewritten to operate without user input. This is usually possible based on assumptions made in the application design.</p>\n        </li>\n      </li>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Redirect and Forward&nbsp;Validation&nbsp;Guidelines</h1>\n  <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"/article/6daf44c7-fe2c-45f6-8854-7aa1e3a1030f\">Calculate Destinations of Redirects and Forwards Without User Input</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>Redirect and Forward Validation&nbsp;Checklists</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/article/a1061c45-7a6e-4257-ab36-f3a693d45ad3\">Destinations of Redirects and Forwards Are Calculated Without User Input</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
