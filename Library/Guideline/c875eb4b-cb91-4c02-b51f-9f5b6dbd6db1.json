Additionally you need to consider what authentication and authorizations options you have and which makes sense for your scenario.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Know your binding options and choose the most appropriate for your scenario. Knowing your binding options enables you to design more reliable and secure WCF application. </p>\n  <p>The following table summarizes common bindings:</p>\n  <p>\n    <br />\n    <table>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <p>\n              <strong>Binding</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n            <p>\n              <strong>Description</strong>\n            </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>basicHttpBinding&nbsp;</td>\n          <td>It represents a bindings that configures and expose endpoints that are able to communicate with ASMX-based Web services and clients and other services that conform to the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1.
