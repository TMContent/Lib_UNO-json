Forming such URLs becomes much more difficult, if unique tokens are included in HTTP requests. </p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>To include unique tokens in HTTP requests:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify sensitive operations.</strong> Review application design and code to identify all operations that require authorization.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify code that performs sensitive operations.</strong> Identify all pages that are involved in performing sensitive operations - this includes both the pages that link to sensitive operations and the code that actually carries out the sensitive operations.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Choose a method for generating unique tokens. </strong>There are different ways to generate unique tokens. One approach is to generate random tokens for each request. Another approach is to use <em>javax.faces.ViewState</em>. A third approach is to use an API designed specifically for mitigating CSRF, such as ESAPI. Do not use session IDs as anti-CSRF tokens.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Add unique tokens to HTTP requests.</strong> Add code that uses the chosen method of generating unique tokens. Add code that adds the generated unique tokens to the pages that link to sensitive operations in hidden fields.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Add token validation code.</strong> Add code to the pages that carry out sensitive operations that validates the unique tokens to make sure that they have been generated on the server-side.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information about preveting Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities, see <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet\">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet</a></li>\r\n  </ul>"
