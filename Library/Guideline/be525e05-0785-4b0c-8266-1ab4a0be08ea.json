This technique is often used by phishers to trick people into visiting fake sites that steal authentication credentials.</p>\r\n  <h1>When</h1>\r\n  <p>Use this guideline when writing a web application that uses redirects or forwards. Avoid using redirects or forwards in web applications, if possible.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Perform the following actions to calculate destinations of redirects and forwards without user input:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Find redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all pages that perform redirects or forwards. </p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Identify dangerous redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all redirects and forwards that rely on user input to calculate their destinations.</p>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Rewrite redirects and forwards.</strong> Consider making design or code changes to get rid of each redirect or forward, if possible. If a redirect or forward is absolutely necessary, consider how it may be rewritten to operate without user input. This is usually possible based on assumptions made in the application design.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Redirects and Forwards Guidelines</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <a href=\"/article/be525e05-0785-4b0c-8266-1ab4a0be08ea\">Calculate Destinations of Redirects and Forwards Without User Input</a>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <a href=\"/article/8a8fe651-2168-4c88-b89a-0b6b442da2f8\">Use Mapping Values When Redirecting on User Input</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>Redirects and Forwards Checklists</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <a href=\"/article/b77c82d9-0a87-4f01-9943-f3a9fc52b561\">Destinations of Redirects and Forwards Are Calculated Without User Input</a>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <a href=\"/article/7bef867d-4dcb-47ea-ac58-651b9552cc1c\">Mapping Values Are Used for Redirects and Forwards</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n\t  </li>\r\n    </ul>"
