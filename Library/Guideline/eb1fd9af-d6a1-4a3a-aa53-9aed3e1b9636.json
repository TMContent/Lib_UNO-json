If your service needs to access specific resources on behalf of the original caller, use impersonation and delegation to flow the caller&#8217;s identity for a downstream authorization check.</p>\r\n  <p>In a development scenario, use the local network service account, which is a special built-in account that has reduced privileges. In a production scenario, create a least-privileged custom domain service account. </p>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance.</p>"
