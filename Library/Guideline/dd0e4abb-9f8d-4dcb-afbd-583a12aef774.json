This option is only available with wsHttpbinding. Keep in mind that non-Microsoft clients will not be able to consume your service if you enable this option. Also consider that there is a performance penalty of negotiating credentials, due to messages exchange. Additionally, consider that allowing negotiation of service credentials is less secure, allowing any client to consume your service.</p>\r\n  <p>The following binding configuration shows how to set this option:</p>\r\n  <pre>&lt;binding name=\"BindingMessage\"&gt;<br />   &lt;security mode=\"Message\"&gt;<br />      &lt;message clientCredentialType=\"Windows\" negotiateServiceCredential=\"true\" /&gt;<br />   &lt;/security&gt;<br />&lt;/binding&gt;<br /></pre>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information on message protection, see “Message Security” at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733137.aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733137.aspx</a><li>For message security Q&A, see the Message Protection section of “WCF 3.5 Questions and Answers“ at <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurityGuide/Wiki/View.aspx?title=WCF%20Questions%20and%20Answers%20%28Q%26A%29&referringTitle=Home\">http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurityGuide/Wiki/View.aspx?title=WCF%20Questions%20and%20Answers%20%28Q%26A%29&referringTitle=Home</a></li></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
