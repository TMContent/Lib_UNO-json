Some examples are:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Authentication attempts</li>\n        <li>Creating user accounts</li>\n        <li>Locking and unlocking user accounts</li>\n        <li>Removing user accounts</li>\n        <li>Changing user access privileges</li>\n        <li>Changing group membership</li>\n        <li>Changing passwords</li>\n        <li>Changing user account details</li>\n        <li>Financial transactions</li>\n        <li>Making changes to the application configuration</li>\n        <li>Starting the application</li>\n        <li>Terminating the application</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Identify log entry details.</strong> For each important security operation on the list, make a list of details that should be included in the log entries.

If this API or the logging subsystem don't exist, write them. Make a list of functions that may be used to generate log entries and collect documentation about how to use them.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Add code that logs important security operations.</strong> Use the list of functions that implement important security operations to add code that generates log entries whenever these operations take place. Log both successful and failed events. Use the list of logging APIs when writing code that generates log entries. Use the list of log entry details when writing code that generates log entries to make sure that the log entries include all the relevant information.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
