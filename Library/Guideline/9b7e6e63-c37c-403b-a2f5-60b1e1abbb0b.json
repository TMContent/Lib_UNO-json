Setting the \"<em>Secure</em>\" flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured by TLS. The \"<em>HTTPOnly</em>\" flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script - this measure helps reduce the potential damage of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>\n  </span>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>To set the \"<em>Secure</em>\" and \"<em>HTTPOnly</em>\" flags on all sensitive cookies:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Verify that TLS is available.</strong> The \"<em>Secure</em>\" flag forces cookies to be sent over TLS. TLS has to be available for this to work.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Identify sensitive cookies.</strong> Session cookies should always be considered sensitive. Enumerate all cookies used by the application. Make a list of cookies that may contain sensitive information.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Identify code that creates sensitive cookies. </strong>For each sensitive cookie in the list, find the code that creates that cookie.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Set the \"S<em>ecure</em>\" and \"<em>HTTPOnly</em>\" flags for each sensitive cookie.</strong> For each piece of code that creates a sensitive cookie, add code that sets the \"S<em>ecure</em>\" and \"<em>HTTPOnly</em>\" flags for the cookie. For example:</p>\n      <pre>Cookie sensitiveCookie = new Cookie(“SessionID”,sessionID);<br />sensitiveCookie.setSecure(true);<br />sensitiveCookie.setHttpOnly(true);</pre>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
