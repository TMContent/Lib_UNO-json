          "## Applies To ##\r\n\r\n* JAVA\r\n* JSP\r\n\r\n\r\n## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nSet the \"Secure\" flag on all sensitive cookies to protect the contents of the sensitive cookies from eavesdropping attacks. Setting the \"Secure\" flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured by TLS. The \"HTTPOnly\" flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script - this measure helps reduce the potential damage of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution Example ## \r\n\r\n~~~~\r\nsensitiveCookie.setSecure(true);\r\nsensitiveCookie.setHttpOnly(true);\r\n~~~~"
