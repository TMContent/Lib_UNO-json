Ensure that the connection string used to identify your credential store is encrypted.</p>\r\n  <p>Also consider storing your credential database on a physically separate server from your Web server. This makes it harder for an attacker to compromise your credential store even if he or she manages to take control of your Web server.</p>\r\n  <h1>Problem Example</h1>\r\n  <p>The following code authenticates a user based on their credentials. Because the code discloses the credentials to the user database, anybody with access to the application's web.config also has access to the credential store.</p>\r\n  <pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &lt;add name=\"MyLocalSQLServer\"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connectionString=\"Server=serv03.example.com;Database=MyAppCredStore;Integrated Security=SSPI;\" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\"/&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;&nbsp; </pre>\r\n  <pre>&lt;membership defaultProvider=\"MySqlMembershipProvider\"&gt;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &lt;providers&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;add name=\"MySqlMembershipProvider\" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connectionStringName=\"MyLocalSQLServer\" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; applicationName=\"MyApp\".../&gt;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &lt;/providers&gt;<br />&lt;/membership&gt;</pre>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
