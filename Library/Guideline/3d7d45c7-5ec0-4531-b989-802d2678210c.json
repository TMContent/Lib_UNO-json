The strength of the algorithm is also important.&amp;nbsp; Larger key sizes result in improved security, but performance suffers. Stronger encryption is most important for persisted data that is retained in data stores for prolonged periods of time.</p>\r\n  <h1>When</h1>\r\n  <p>If your application uses cryptography to provide security, examine what algorithm and key size it uses and the way it is used.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p />It is important to make sure you choose the right algorithm for the right job and to make sure you use a key size that provides a sufficient degree of security. Larger key sizes generally increase security. The following list summarizes the major algorithms together with the key sizes that each uses: <ul><li>Data Encryption Standard (DES) 64-bit key (8 bytes) <li>TripleDES 128-bit key or 192-bit key (16 or 24 bytes) <li>Rijndael 128-256 bit keys (16-32 bytes) <li>RSA 384-16,384 bit keys (48-2,048 bytes) </li></li></li></li></ul><p>For large data encryption, use the TripleDES symmetric encryption algorithm (also&amp;nbsp;called Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, TDEA) . For slower and stronger encryption of large data, use Rijndael,&amp;nbsp;also known as Advanced Encryption Standard(AES). As per NIST&amp;nbsp;recomendations, 192-256-bit AES&amp;nbsp;keys are required for highly sensitive data.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To encrypt data that is to be stored for short periods of time, you can consider using a faster but weaker algorithm such as DES. For digital signatures, use Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) or Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). NIST guidelines suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent&amp;nbsp;to 256-bit symmetric keys in strength. For hashing, use the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)1.0. For keyed hashes, use the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) SHA1.0.</p><h1>Additional Resources</h1><ul><li>For more information see, \"Chapter 4 - Design Guidelines for Secure Web Applications\" at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302420.aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302420.aspx</a></li></ul><h1>&amp;nbsp;</h1><hr /><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance.</p>"
