Identify all cases where a component would require a privilege that is otherwise not needed by the rest of your application. For example, all code that accesses the file system should be placed within a single assembly.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Partition your application</strong>: Store all major functionality into separate assemblies. Adding this level of granularity to your application provides extra flexibility when applying your application's security settings. ASP.NET provides the following types of assemblies:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Page assemblies</strong>: By default, each ASP.NET page is compiled into its own assembly that is then loaded into the ASP.NET engine. Security configuration for such assemblies is stored inside <em>web.config</em>. </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Executable assemblies</strong>: Typically known as external libraries or DLL, these assemblies can be re-used outside of ASP.NET development. Security settings for such assemblies is managed through <em>app.config</em>.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Problem Example</h1>\n  <p>MyApp is the HR application for MyCorp. Among its basic features for keeping track of employee records, the application allows document and calendar sharing that allows MyCorp's HR staff to be up-to-date on daily activities. Because the application is compiled as a single assembly, it is impossible to assign different security settings for its calendar and document sharing features. Therefore a successfully exploited vulnerability in the calendar feature could lead to compromising shared documents. </p>\n  <h1>Solution Example</h1>\n  <p>MyApp is the HR application for MyCorp. Among its basic features for keeping track of employee records, the application allows document and calendar sharing that allows MyCorp's HR staff to be up-to-date on daily activities. Since the calendar and document features are compiled as separate assemblies, the developers are able to assign the appropriate security policies for each component; therefore preventing an attacker from compromising shared documents through successfully exploiting a vulnerability in the calendar feature.</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
