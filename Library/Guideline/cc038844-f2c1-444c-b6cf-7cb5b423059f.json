When a user enters a password \"password\", the masked field may look like \"********\".</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Masking password fields helps protect user passwords from someone that may be looking at their screen.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>To mask all password fields:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify all password-type fields in the application.</strong> Review all the pages in the application to find all password-type fields. Password-type fields include secret answers, CVV, PIN, and other data, which is equivalent to passwords.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p />\r\n      <strong>Use password fields that mask user input.</strong> Masking password fields is usually done by using a \"password\" type HTML input field, like so:<pre>&lt;form&gt;<br />...<br />&lt;input type=\"password\" name=\"pass\" AUTOCOMPLETE=\"off\"/&gt;<br />...<br />&lt;/form&gt; </pre><p>Please, note that the <em>autocomplete</em> property is set to \"off\" - this prevents the browser from remembering the password in its autocomplete list. Preventing the browser from storing passwords in the autocomplete list protects the passwords from being compromised if the user's operating system is compromised.</p></li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <br />"
