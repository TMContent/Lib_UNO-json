This technique is often used by phishers to trick people into visiting fake sites that steal authentication credentials.</p>\r\n  <h1>When</h1>\r\n  <p>Use this guideline when writing a web application that uses redirects or forwards. Avoid using redirects or forwards in web applications, if possible.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Perform the following actions to calculate destinations of redirects and forwards without user input:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Find redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all pages that perform redirects or forwards. Redirects are also known as \"transfers\" in .NET.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify dangerous redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all redirects and forwards that rely on user input to calculate their destinations.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Rewrite redirects and forwards.</strong> Consider making design or code changes to get rid of each redirect or forward, if possible. If a redirect or forward is absolutely necessary, consider how it may be rewritten to operate without user input - this is usually possible based on assumptions made in the application design.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>"
