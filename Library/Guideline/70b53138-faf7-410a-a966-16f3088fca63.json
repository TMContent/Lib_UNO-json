Label each component as low or high level:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Low level:</strong> Low-level components are closely tied to the hardware and operating system. Although low-level components are commonly written in native code, Java provides support for the most basic operations such as filesystem access, sockets, etc. <li><strong>High level:</strong> High-level components hold the business logic within an application. Their loose coupling with hardware and operating systems allows them to be implemented 100&#37; using Java. </li></li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Reduce calls into native code. </strong>Determine which functionalities should be executed in native code. Ensure that native code is called from as few locations in your application as possible. Segregate functionality that requires native code so that its use is isolated into a small number of components.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Problem Example</h1>\r\n  <p>The following segment shows JNI code that utilizes a COM object.
