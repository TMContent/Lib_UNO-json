You can use netTCPbinding for better performance than HTTP bindings.&nbsp; netTcpbinding by default uses binary encoding and transport security.</p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information on choosing a transport, see “Choosing a Transport”&nbsp; at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733769.aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733769.aspx</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
