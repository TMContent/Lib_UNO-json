As a result, a program could overwrite or access an unintended file. open() provides the control that fopen() does not.</p>\n  <h1>When</h1>\n  <p>Use this guideline whenever creating files programmatically on UN&#42;X systems.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Perform the following actions to open files safely on UN&#42;X systems:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Review code.</strong> Search for all calls to the fopen() function.</p>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Use open() instead of fopen().</strong> Replace calls to fopen() with open(). Use open() with the following flags:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              <strong>O_CREAT &#124; O_EXCL.</strong> When creating a new file, the call will fail if the file already exists. This prevents the call from overwriting an existing file.</p>\n            <li>\n              <p>\n                <strong>O_NOFOLLOW.</strong> Ensures that the system will not follow a symlink thereby accessing another file unexpectedly.</p>\n            </li>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
