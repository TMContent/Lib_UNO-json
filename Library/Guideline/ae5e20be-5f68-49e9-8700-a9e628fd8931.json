Consider implementing functionality for sending logs to an external log server. One common protocol for sending logs to a log server is syslog (RFC 5424).</p>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Implement logging.</strong> Add code that records the following details in log entries:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>User identification<li>Type of event<li>Date and time stamp<li>Success or failure indication<li>Source of event<li>Names or other identifiers of affected data or resources</li></li></li></li></li></li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      </li>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
