While you may have control over the source code for the clients that call your service, clients can be reverse engineered or built from scratch to attack your service.&nbsp; Use client-side validation to reduce round trips to the server and to improve the user experience, but always use validation in the service itself to perform security checks.</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
