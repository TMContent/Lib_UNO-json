If you choose a key that is too large, your system will be subject to a performance impact without a commensurate real-world improvement in security. The appropriate key size changes based on the cryptographic algorithm in use, and also changes over time as machine processing speeds increase and attack techniques become more sophisticated. <br />The following recommendations will give you a margin of safety without sacrificing too much performance: </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>When you use an asymmetric algorithm (RSA), choose a 2048-bit key </li>\n    <li>When you use a symmetric algorithm (AES), choose a 128-bit key </li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
