          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>Check to ensure that sensitive data stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE is protected by ACLs.</p>\r\n  <p />\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>If you store sensitive data in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE section of the registry, consider applying an ACL to the registry key that restricts access to a specific account, such as the account under which your application runs. This is important because any process running on your computer has access to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE section of the registry. By isolating your application and running it under a dedicated custom account, only your application can access the data from the ACL-protected key.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <b>Note</b>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Use of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE makes it easier to store configuration data at installation time and maintain it later on.</blockquote>\r\n  <p>If your security requirements dictate an even less accessible storage solution, use a key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. This approach means that you do not have to explicitly configure ACLs because access to the current user key is automatically restricted based on process identity.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <b>Note</b>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;HKEY_CURRENT_USER allows more restrictive access because a process can access the current user key only if the user profile associated with the current thread or process token is loaded.</blockquote>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance.</p>"
