          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\n  <p>Check if security architecture and design reviews have been conducted.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>If you spend time and effort at the beginning of your project to analyze and review your application architecture and design, you can eliminate design-related vulnerabilities and improve your application’s overall security. It is much easier and less expensive to fix vulnerabilities at design time than it is later in the development cycle when substantial re-engineering might be required. Use the architecture and design review as a checkpoint to ensure compliance with your team’s design guidelines. The review should cover both deployment and design considerations. By considering your design in relation to the target deployment environment and the security policies defined by that environment, you can help to ensure a smoother and more secure application deployment. Perform architecture and design reviews iteratively as your design evolves or as you learn more about the design and architecture of your applications. If your application has already been created, the architecture and design review is still an important part of the security assessment process that can help you to fix vulnerabilities and improve future designs.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>Check project documentation to verify that security architecture and design reviews have been conducted and documented.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Use a question driven approach to expose the highest risk design decisions and use the security frame to dive into areas that reveal common mistakes. The following techniques can help to guide your approach when reviewing the architecture and design of your application:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Deployment and infrastructure.</strong> Review the design of your application in relation to the target deployment environment and the associated security policies. Consider the restrictions imposed by the underlying infrastructure layer security.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Security frame.</strong> Review the approach to critical areas in your application, including authentication, authorization, input / data validation, exception management, and other areas. Use the application vulnerability categories as a roadmap and to make sure that you do not miss any key areas during the review.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Tier-by-tier analysis.</strong> Walk through the logical tiers of your application, and evaluate security choices within your presentation, business, and data access layers.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Use checklists to help you perform architecture and design reviews while evaluating the security of your applications. The checklists should help you explore the high level design and architecture decisions that have been made for your application. You should evolve your checklists to include custom checks based on the unique aspects of your application’s architecture. Patterns & practices security guidance includes checklists for each major application type. Use these checklists as a starting point and add new items as you learn more about architecture and design reviews. </p>\n  <br />"
