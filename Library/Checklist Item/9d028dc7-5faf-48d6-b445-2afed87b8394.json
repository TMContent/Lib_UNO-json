This technique is often used by phishers to trick people into trusting a fake web site.</p>\r\n  <h1>How To Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the following steps to verify that redirects and forwards are not used unless necessary:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Review application design.</strong> Look through project documentation for any mentions of redirects or forwards (also known as transfers in .NET). Ideally, there should be no redirects or forwards in the application design.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Review code.</strong> Search code for redirects or forwards. Because there are many different ways to implement redirects and forwards, look through every page for code that handles parameters, and verify that this code doesn't perform redirects or forwards based on input.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>How To Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Perform the following actions to avoid using redirects or forwards:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Enumerate redirects and forwards.</strong> Review application code to find all redirects and forwards used by the application.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Review application design.</strong> Determine how redirects and forwards figure into the application design. Consider making design changes to remove the need for redirects and forwards.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Remove redirects or forwards.</strong> Remove the redirects and forwards that are not necessary after changes to the application design.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Secure the remaining redirects or forwards.</strong> If there appears to be no reasonable way to get rid of redirects or forwards, use related guidelines to secure the remaining redirects or forwards.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <br />\r\n  <h1>\r\n  </h1>\r\n  <h1>\r\n  </h1>"
