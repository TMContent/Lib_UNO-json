Allocating a large enough buffer to fit data being copied is vital for preventing buffer overflows.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Find all the uses of the sizeof() function. Verify that pointers are not passed as arguments to sizeof() when calculating sizes of arrays. When an array is passed as an argument to a function, it is passed as a pointer. Calling sizeof() on an array that is passed as a parameter returns the size of a pointer, not the size of the array. To get the size of an array correctly, call sizeof() in the scope where the array is declared and store the return value in a variable. When copying data, pass the variable that contains the size of the array as an argument together with data to be copied.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Call sizeof() in the scope where the array is declared and store the return value in a variable. When copying data, pass the variable that contains the size of the array as an argument together with data to be copied.</p>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information about computing the sizes of arrays correctly, please see \"ARR01-CPP.
