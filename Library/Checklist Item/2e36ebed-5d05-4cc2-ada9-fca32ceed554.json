Other ICMP vulnerabilities exist that justify blocking this protocol. While ICMP can be used for troubleshooting, it can also be used for network discovery and mapping. Therefore, control the use of ICMP. If you must enable it, use it in echo-reply mode only.</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
