Validating the sizes of strings before using them prevents buffer overflows.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>Identify functions that accept strings as arguments. Verify that input and data validation functions are called before these strings are used. Verify that these data and input validation functions check string sizes.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>It is recommended to use a centralized input and data validation class or library. Add code to that class or library to validate string sizes. </p>\n  <p>Identify functions that accept strings as arguments. Add code to these functions that calls validation routines to verify that string size is acceptable.</p>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n  </ul>"
