For the anonymous account, create a group and add the anonymous account to it and then explicitly deny access to the group for key directories and files. Assigning permissions to a group allows you to more easily change the anonymous account or create additional anonymous accounts because you do not need to recreate the permissions. </p><blockquote><b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IISLockdown denies write access to content directories for the anonymous account by applying a deny write access control entry (ACE) for the Web Anonymous Users and Web Applications groups. It also adds a deny execute ACL on command-line tools.</blockquote><li><b>Use separate accounts for separate applications</b>. \r\n<p>If your Web server hosts multiple applications, use a separate anonymous account for each application. Add the accounts to an anonymous Web users group, for example, the <b>Web Anonymous Users</b> group created by IISLockdown, and then configure NTFS permissions using this group. </p><p>For more information about using multiple anonymous accounts and hosting multiple applications, see Chapter 20, \"<a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302436.aspx\">Hosting Multiple ASP.NET Applications</a>.\" </p></li></li></li></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
