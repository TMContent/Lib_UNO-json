          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>Ensure all test accounts have been removed.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Test accounts provide access to the application's functionality during development. Since they are often poorly secured, they are a common target for attackers, so it is recommended to remove all test accounts before deployment.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the following steps to ensure that your application has all of its test accounts removed:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Check if your application has existing test users. </strong>Enumerate all of your application's users. Verify that there are no test accounts in your application's user database. A common list of test accounts includes, but is not limited to:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Any account containing your application's name and a number </li>\r\n        <li>Any account containing the word \"test\" and a number </li>\r\n        <li>Any account that has been identified in your application's documentation as being a test account</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Check if your application has hard-coded users. </strong>Verify that your application's code base does not contain any hard-coded users. A hard-coded user is a sequence of a&nbsp;username and password that is initialized to a value at the time when your application starts. Example:</p>\r\n      <pre>String user = \"test002\";<br />char[] pass = {'p','a','s','s'};</pre>or <pre>String user = \"test002\";<br />char[] pass = \"pass\".toCharArray();</pre>Common locations to look for hard-coded users include: <ul><li>Authentication procedures </li><li>Authorization procedures </li><li>Procedures that involve change of privileges </li><li>Components that require access controls</li></ul></li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Check if your application has existing test roles. </strong>Verify that there are no existing test roles left in your application. Common test roles include:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Any role containing the word \"test\" </li>\r\n        <li>Any role that is identified as a test role in your application's documentation </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Check if your application has special privileges for test roles. </strong>Verify that there are no conditions throughout your application's code base that grant test roles special permissions, such as:</p>\r\n      <pre>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)<br />       throws ServletException, IOException<br /> {<br />       // The application provides a side door allowing users in the testRole<br />       // role to execute functionality that is entitled only to users in the<br />       // Manager role<br />       if (req.isUserInRole(\"Manager\") || req.isUserInRole(\"testRole\"))<br />       {<br />            ...<br />       }<br />       else<br />       {<br />            ...<br />       }<br /> }</pre>Common locations to look for special privileges to test roles include: <ul><li>Authorization procedures </li><li>Procedures that involve change of privileges </li><li>Components that require access controls</li></ul></li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the following steps when removing test accounts:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Enumerate all accounts. </strong>List all the users&nbsp;of your application. This should be a comprehensive list that includes, but is not limited to, active users, inactive users, users pending confirmation and test accounts.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify the use of each account. </strong>Examine the use/status of each account. Sort the accounts into groups according to their use/status.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Remove the accounts that will no longer be used. </strong>Once the accounts are sorted into groups, list all accounts that are used for test purposes. After identifying all test accounts, remove them from your application's database.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Enforce strong passwords on the remaining accounts. </strong>After removing all test accounts, enforce strong passwords for the remaining accounts in your application. Strong passwords decrease the probability of compromising valid users. <br /></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS requirements state that passwords should be at least seven characters in length, use both letters and numbers, expire after no more than 90 days and that new passwords should not be the same as the previous four by the same user.</p>\r\n  <h1>Problem Example</h1>\r\n  <p>The following segment illustrates the user database of a multi-user application. The problem with the user database is the existence of test accounts after the deployment of the application:</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <pre>sql&gt; select username from users;<br />+----------+<br />| username |<br />+----------+<br />| joe      |<br />| adam     |<br />| john     |<br />| bob      |<br />| jim      |<br />| sean     |<br />| ellen    |<br />| mary     |<br />| susan    |<br />| julie    |<br />| test01   |<br />| test02   |<br />| test03   |<br />+----------+</pre>\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n  <h1>Solution Example</h1>\r\n  <p>The following segment illustrates the user database of a multi-user application. The user database is populated with active users and no test accounts:</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <pre>sql&gt; select username from users;<br />+----------+<br />| username |<br />+----------+<br />| joe      |<br />| adam     |<br />| john     |<br />| bob      |<br />| jim      |<br />| sean     |<br />| ellen    |<br />| mary     |<br />| susan    |<br />| julie    |<br />+----------+</pre>\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n  <h1>Java Deployment Guidelines</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/f21f5350-826d-44dd-b758-fd824d52f592\">Remove Test Accounts</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/df860f3d-2185-4939-be4b-ef26d8891855\">Remove Test Interfaces</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/fd675679-e8ad-40fc-bac4-d56fc440bc00\">Disable Directory Browsing</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/aebb10ce-aeb6-45e5-b159-e2bc76b012bf\">Use a Least-Privileged Account for Running Applications</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/3f301ff9-098d-46cb-ac53-cb3fa6897cdf\">Protect Sensitive Data Inside Configuration Files</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>Java Deployment Checklists</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/256b4884-9ff0-4a33-960c-305b824bab68\">Test Accounts Are Removed</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/65e70f79-645d-415c-9e71-9cff045cc1c4\">Directory Browsing Is Disabled</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/a2000bc9-7e22-4d0c-91b8-a9ec623985d3\">A Least Privileged Account Is Used for Running Applications</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/f9c1e6b0-1bc4-4108-9c9a-55dca84749ac\">Sensitive Data Inside Configuration Files Is Protected</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
