These are used by ASP.NET to protect ViewState and forms authentication tickets. Manually generated, common keys are required because you cannot guarantee which server will handle successive requests.</p>\r\n  <p>With manually generated key values, the &lt;<b>machineKey</b>&gt; settings should be similar to the following example.</p>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <pre>&lt;machineKey validationKey=\"21F090935F6E49C2C797F69BBAAD8402ABD2EE0B667A8B4<br />             4EA7DD4374267A75D7AD972A119482D15A4127461DB1DC347C1A63AE5F1CCFAACFF1B72A7F0A281B\"<br />             decryptionKey=\"261F793EB53B761503AC445E0CA28DA44AA9B3CF06263B77\"<br />             decryption=\"3DES\"<br />             validation=\"SHA1\" /&gt;</pre>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
