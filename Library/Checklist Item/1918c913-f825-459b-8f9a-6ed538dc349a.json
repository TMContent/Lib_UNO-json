These are unauthenticated or anonymous sessions established between two computers. Unless null sessions are disabled, an attacker can connect to your server anonymously (without being authenticated).</p>\n  <p>Once an attacker establishes a null session, he or she can perform a variety of attacks, including enumeration techniques used to collect system-related information from the target computer â€” information that can greatly assist subsequent attacks. The type of information that can be returned over a null session includes domain and trust details, shares, user information (including groups and user rights), registry keys, and more.</p>\n  <p>Restrict Null sessions by setting <b>RestrictAnonymous</b> to <b>1</b> in the registry at the following subkey:</p>\n  <p>\n    <b>HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA\\RestrictAnonymous=1</b>\n  </p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 246261, \"How To: Use the RestrictAnonymous Registry Value in Windows 2000.\" at <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/246261\">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/246261</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <b>\n    </b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
