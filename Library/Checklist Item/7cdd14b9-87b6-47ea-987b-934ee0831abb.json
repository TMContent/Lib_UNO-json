          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>Ensure all test accounts have been removed.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Test accounts provide access to the application's functionality during development. Since they are often poorly secured and monitored, they are a common target for attackers.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the following steps to ensure your application has all of its test accounts removed:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Check if your application has existing test users. </strong>Enumerate all of your application's users. Verify that there are no test accounts in your application's user database. Common test accounts include, but are not limited to:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Any account name that includes the application's name </li>\r\n        <li>Any account name containing the word \"test\" </li>\r\n        <li>Any account that has been identified in your application's documentation as being a test account</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Check if your application has hard-coded users. </strong>Verify that your application's code base does not contain any hard-coded users. A hard-coded user is a username and password that is initialized to a fixed value when your application starts. For example:</p>\r\n      <pre>string user = \"test002\";char[] pass = {'p','a','s','s'};</pre>\r\n      <p>or </p>\r\n      <pre>string user = \"test002\";char[] pass = \"pass\".ToCharArray();</pre>Common locations to look for hard-coded users include: <ul><li>Authentication procedures </li><li>Authorization procedures </li><li>Procedures that involve change of privileges </li><li>Components that require access controls</li></ul></li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Check if your application has existing test roles. </strong>Verify that there are no existing test roles left in your application. Common test roles are: </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Any role containing the word \"test\" </li>\r\n        <li>Any role that is identified as a test role in your application's documentation </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <strong>Check if your application has special privileges for test roles. </strong>Verify that there are no conditions throughout your application's code base that grant special permissions to test roles. Common locations to look for special privileges to test roles include: <ul><li>Authorization procedures </li><li>Procedures that involve change of privileges </li><li>Components that require access controls</li></ul></li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Verify that the application is not being run as a Test user on the server. </strong>It is common to run applications with more privileges than necessary when debugging. However, only the least privileges should be available in the production environment. <br /></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Problem Example</h1>\r\n  <p>The following segment illustrates the user database of a multi-user application. By looking at the other data in the users table, such as user description, status, etc, we can deduce which of the accounts are necessary and which of them exist only for testing purposes. The problem with the user database in this example is the existence of test accounts after the deployment of the application, which can be determined by looking at the status column data. </p>\r\n  <p />\r\n  <pre>sql&gt; select username, status from users;<br />+----------+-----------+<br />| username | status    |<br />+----------+-----------+<br />| joe      | active    |<br />| adam     | active    |<br />| john     | inactive  |<br />| bob      | active    |<br />| jim      | active    |<br />| sean     | inactive  |<br />| ellen    | active    |<br />| mary     | active    |<br />| susan    | active    |<br />| julie    | active    |<br />| test01   | test      |<br />| test02   | test      |<br />| test03   | test      |<br />+----------+-----------+</pre>\r\n  <p />\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>To learn more about securing your application's accounts, visit: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302432.aspx#c16618429_013\">Securing Your Web Server: Step 5, Accounts</a>. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>Related Guideline</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/058ce803-1871-4365-acc1-51219a7f8a1b\">Guideline: Remove Test Accounts&nbsp;</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
