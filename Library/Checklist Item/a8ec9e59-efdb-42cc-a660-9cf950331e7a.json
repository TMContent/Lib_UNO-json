Encryption keys should be encrypted and stored separately to make sure that if the data backups are stolen, the attackers don't have the keys to go with them.</p>\r\n  <h1>How To Check</h1>\r\n  <p>To verify that off-site backups are encrypted:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify data to backup. </strong>Make a list of assets that should be backed up off-site.</p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Identify the encryption suite.</strong> Identify the software solution used to encrypt off-site backups.
