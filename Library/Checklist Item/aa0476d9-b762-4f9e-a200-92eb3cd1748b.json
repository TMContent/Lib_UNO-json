Identify the schedule used by the vendor to release updates; typically vendors release patches on a set schedule or whenever new vulnerabilities are discovered. Make a list of all sources for software updates with notes on when new updates may be available.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Establish patching documentation.</strong> Start a document to keep track of installed patches and any issues that may crop up. Every now and again, a vendor patch may break something or fail to install correctly. Document these situations and the solutions. It is important to record the time when patches are installed.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Establish a process for installing updates.</strong> Schedule periodic checks for new security updates. If possible, time these checks to match the vendor release schedules. Go through the list of vendor sources, check for new patches, download and install them, and document the process.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Delegate responsibility. </strong>Once the process for installing updates and the documentation are established, delegate responsibility for these tasks to a system administrator.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For timely notifications about PHP updates, please see the PHP announcements mailing list at <a href=\"http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php\">http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <br />"
