          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>Ensure all public interfaces used solely for testing the application are removed.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Test interfaces add extra functionality that is not intended for the released application. Often these interfaces will be used by a test team to gain information or drive functionality that would be dangerous in the hands of an attacker.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Verify that all test interfaces have been removed by doing the following:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify all test APIs</strong>: Enumerate all public APIs. Identify which APIs are intended for application use and which APIs are intended for test purposes. Use documentation and specifications to help.</p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Verify that all testing code is removed from the code base</strong>: Locate the implementation for the identified test code. Ensure that it has been isolated from the application.</p>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Ensure that the application was compiled with the release flag</strong>: Open the project for the application with Visual Studio. From the <strong>Build</strong> Menu select <strong>Configuration Manager</strong>. Check that the <strong>active solution configuration</strong> is set to <strong>Release</strong>.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p>Care should be taken when managing different versions of builds to ensure that only release builds are used in production, as it is difficult (although possible) to determine whether a build was configured as release or debug after the fact.</p>\r\n  <h1>Problem Example</h1>\r\n  <p>The following code shows the user management system for an application. Because the class contains test APIs, it is possible for a malicious user to execute untested code and possibly exploit any vulnerabilities in it.</p>\r\n  <p />\r\n  <pre>public sealed class UserManager<br />&#123;<br />      public UserManager()<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      public boolean AddUser(User user, char&#91;&#93; pass, char&#91;&#93; verifyPass)<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      public boolean RemoveUser(User user)<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      public boolean ModifyUser(User user)<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      public boolean ChangePass(User user, char&#91;&#93; oldPass, char&#91;&#93; pass, char&#91;&#93; verifyPass)<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />      // The class contains test APIs<br />      public void AddTestUsers()<br />      &#123;<br />            ...<br />      &#125;<br />&#125;</pre>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>To learn more about compiling your application with debug and release configurations, see: <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wx0123s5(vs.80).aspx\">How to: Set Debug and Release Configurations</a>&nbsp;in MSDN.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>Related Guideline</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/880d6dff-ebeb-40b9-9bc2-d41997813dee\">Guideline: Remove Test Interfaces&nbsp;</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
