On IIS 6 and later, they run inside an application pool using the least privileged Network Service account. If you need to use a custom service account to run your ASP.NET Web application, create a least-privileged account. You might need to create a custom service account to isolate your application from other applications on the same server or to be able to audit each application separately. </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <b>To create a least privileged account</b>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>Create a local or domain Windows account. </p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p />Run the following Aspnet_regiis.exe command to assign the relevant ASP.NET permissions to the account: <p><b>aspnet_regiis.exe -ga machineName\\userName</b></p><p>On Windows Server 2003 and later, running the Aspnet_regiis.exe -ga command will add the account to the IIS_WPG group. The IIS_WPG group provides the <b>Log on as a batch job</b> user right and ensures that the necessary file system permissions are granted. </p><li><p>Use the Local Security Policy tool to grant the Windows account the <b>Deny logon locally</b> user right. This reduces the privileges of the account and prevents anyone logging onto Windows locally with the account. </p><li><p>Use IIS Manager to create an application pool running under the new account's identity and assign your ASP.NET application to the pool.<b></b></p></li></li></li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
