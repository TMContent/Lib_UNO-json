Also secure log files in a central location. Modern routers have an array of logging features that include the ability to set severities based on the data logged. An&nbsp;auditing schedule should be established to routinely inspect logs for signs of intrusion and probing.</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
