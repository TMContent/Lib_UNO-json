All entities, excluding your application, must be prohibited access to the provider's credential store. </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Database:</strong> If your application uses a database as its credential store, ensure that the appropriate database security is applied. All entities, excluding your application, must be prohibited access to the provider's credential store.</p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>How To Fix</h1>\n  <p>Consider limiting access to only your application's account. Ensure that the connection string used to identify your credential store is encrypted.</p>\n  <p>Also consider storing your credential database on a physically separate server from your Web server. This makes it harder for an attacker to compromise your credential store even if he or she manages to take control of your Web server.</p>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <em>You may find these additional articles useful</em>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/article/76a0cdc0-6792-41a8-9212-4e190ed6882f\">Limit Access to the Credential Store</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>\n  <h1>\n  </h1>"
