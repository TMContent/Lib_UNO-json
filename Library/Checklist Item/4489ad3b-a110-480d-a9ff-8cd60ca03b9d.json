          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>Ensure that absolute URLs are used for navigation where the site is partitioned with secure and non-secure folders.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Navigating between the public and restricted areas of your site (that is, between HTTP and HTTPS pages) is an issue because a redirect always uses the protocol (HTTPS or HTTP) of the current page, not the target page.</p>\r\n  <h1>How To Check</h1>\r\n  <p>To make sure that absolute URLs are used for navigating secure pages:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Verify that absolute URLs are used for navigating from secure pages.</strong> Examine all secure pages to make sure that all links, especially dynamically generated links use absolute URLs.</p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Verify that absolute URLs are used when redirecting to secure pages.</strong> Find all pages that redirect to secure pages and make sure they use absolute URLs to address secure pages.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>How To Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the following guidelines when implementing navigation on a site that uses TLS:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Use absolute URLs when navigating from secure pages. </strong>After a user logs on and browses pages in a directory that is secured with TLS, relative links such as \"<em>..\\publicpage.aspx</em>\" or redirects to HTTP pages result in the pages being served using the HTTPS protocol, which incurs an unnecessary performance overhead. To avoid this, use absolute links such as \"<em>http://servername/appname/publicpage.aspx</em>\" when redirecting from an HTTPS page to an HTTP page.</p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Use absolute URLs when redirecting to secure pages.</strong> Similarly, when you redirect to a secure page (for example, the logon page) from a public area of your site, you must use an absolute HTTPS path, such as \"<em>https://servername/appname/secure/login.aspx</em>\" instead of a relative path, such as \"<em>restricted/login.aspx</em>\". For example, if your Web page provides a logon button, use the following code to redirect to the secure login page.</p>\r\n        <pre>private void btnLogon_Click( object sender, System.EventArgs e )<br />{<br />  // Form an absolute path using the server name and virtual directory name  <br />  string serverName =<br />   HttpUtility.UrlEncode(Request.ServerVariables[\"SERVER_NAME\"]);  <br />   string vdirName = Request.ApplicationPath;<br />   Response.Redirect(\"https://\" +<br />    serverName + vdirName + \"/Restricted/Login.aspx\");<br />}</pre>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/ac94abdd-9e11-4231-857c-86d0095bdcdc\">Use Absolute URLs for Navigating Secure Pages</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
