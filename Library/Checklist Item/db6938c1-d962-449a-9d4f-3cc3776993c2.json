If this API or the logging subsystems don't exist, it is recommended to write them.

Make a list of functions that may be used to generate log entries and collect documentation about how to use them.</p>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Add code that generates log entries.</strong> Use the list of functions that perform authentication and add code to each one to generate log entries.
