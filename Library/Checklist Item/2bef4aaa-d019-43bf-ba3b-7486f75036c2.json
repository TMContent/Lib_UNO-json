          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>Ensure your application allows its users to verify the authenticity of your application.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Some applications are targets for phishing attacks. Failure to provide authentication of the application&amp;nbsp;for the user allows attackers to spoof the application, therefore, fooling the users into submitting their credentials or other sensitive information into an attacker's malicious application.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the following steps to ensure the application is capable of proving its authenticity to its users:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Ensure that your application uses SSL to identify itself to the user. </strong>Check that your application's environment has enabled HTTPS. Verify that transactions of a sensitive nature are transmitted only over HTTPS connections. Check if the &lt;forms&gt; element in your application's <strong>web.config</strong> file has the <strong>requireSSL</strong> attribute set to \"true\" when performing form-based authentication:</p>\r\n      <pre>&lt;authentication mode=\"Forms\"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;forms loginUrl=\"login.aspx\"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protection=\"All\"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; timeout=\"20\"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <strong>requireSSL=\"true\"</strong>&gt;&amp;nbsp; <br />&lt;/forms&gt;<br />&lt;/authentication &gt;</pre>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Check if your application displays a shared secret with its users. </strong>Check if your application has a personal shared secret for each of its users. Shared secrets include, but are not limited to, combinations of any of the following:</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <strong>Layout</strong>: a user-defined layout/color scheme <li><strong>Picture</strong>: a user-defined image <li><strong>Word/Phrase</strong>: a user-defined word, phrase, or question</li></li></li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Verify that the shared secret is displayed to the user after providing their ID and before providing their credentials.</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Problem Example</h1>\r\n  <p>MyApp is a financial application with a public web interface. Because the application does not use SSL to certify its identity in front of the user, an attacker can set up a fake site and pretend to be MyApp. Because the user's browser has no mechanism of&amp;nbsp;differentiating the real from the fake MyApp interface, it will not provide any warning signs to the user. Once a user accesses the fake MyApp interface,&amp;nbsp;he may be fooled into providing&amp;nbsp;his credentials to the attacker.</p>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>To learn more about anti-phishing techniques, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing#Anti-phishing\">Phishing</a> in Wikipedia. </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>Related Guideline</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/40188a30-1dab-4905-93ba-377068d670ca\">Guideline: Verify the Application's Authenticity to the User&amp;nbsp;</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </p>"
