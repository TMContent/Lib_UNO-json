To enforce Medium trust for all Web applications on a server, use the following configuration in the machine-level Web.config file. </p>\n  <p>\n    <pre>&lt;location allowOverride=\"false\"&gt;<br />  &lt;system.web&gt;<br />   &lt;trust level=\"Medium\" originUrl=\"\" /&gt;<br />  &lt;/system.web&gt;<br /> &lt;/location&gt;  </pre>\n  </p>\n  <p>By setting <b>allowOverride=\"false\"</b>, an individual developer is unable to override the Medium trust policy setting in his or her application's Web.config file.</p>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
