You are generally recommended to use Windows integrated authentication, but you can also use Basic, Digest, or client certificate authentication. You must also ensure that the <b>mode</b> attribute on the &lt;<b>authentication</b>&gt; element is set to \"Windows\" (the default setting) in your Web.config file. </p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/4888ef0b-253e-4b1f-9f19-59bbc4cb5fdd\">Guideline: Choose Windows Authentication When You Can</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
