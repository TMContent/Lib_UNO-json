Unfortunately, the developers did not disable directory browsing. Directory browsing reveals critical clues which can be used to determine what software is being used on the server and how it is configured. It enables attackers to search for and download unprotected configuration files, source code, libraries, or data files. After finding and decompiling a library the attacker was able to discover another weakness and compromise the server further. </p>\n  <br />\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </p>"
