          "## What to Check For ##\r\n\r\nVerify that deallocation functions don't throw exceptions.\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nDeallocation functions may be called when exceptions are thrown. If a deallocation function throws an exception after being called when an exception is thrown, the program may terminate. This may result in a denial-of-service vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## How to Check ##\r\n\r\nSearch for deallocation functions. Verify that deallocation functions don't throw exceptions.\r\n\r\n## How to Fix ##\r\n\r\nIdentify deallocation functions that throw exceptions and rewrite them in such a way that they don't throw exceptions.\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources ##\r\n\r\n - For more information about not throwing exceptions from deallocation functions,  see [https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/DCL58-CPP.+Destructors+and+deallocation+functions+must+be+declared+noexcept](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/DCL58-CPP.+Destructors+and+deallocation+functions+must+be+declared+noexcept)\r\n\r\n"
