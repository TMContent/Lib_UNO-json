Strong cryptographic algorithms are AES, RSA, Elliptic Curve, and NTRU.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>As commercially available computer power rapidly increases and new threats emerge, it becomes more and more important to use strong cryptographic algorithms to secure sensitive data. Strong cryptographic algorithms assure that an attacker cannot break encryption in a timely manner.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>Identify cryptographic algorithms that are used. Verify that only strong cryptographic algorithms are used.</p>\n  <p>Strong symmetric algorithms are AES and to a lesser extent 3-DES. Strong assymetric encryption algorithms are RSA, Elliptic Curve, and NTRU. </p>\n  <p>The recommended key strengths are: 256-bit or more for AES, 3-DES key length is fixed at 168-bit, 1024-bit or more for RSA, 384-bit for Elliptic Curve cryptography, and 80-bit for NTRU.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Use strong cryptographic algorithms and appropriate key lengths.</p>\n  <p>Strong symmetric algorithms are AES and to a lesser extent 3-DES.
