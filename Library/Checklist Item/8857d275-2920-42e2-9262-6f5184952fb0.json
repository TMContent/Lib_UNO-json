Subject it to the same level of scrutiny that you would subject any other untrusted file, network, or user input. To avoid potentially damaging data being injected into the object, validate each field as it is reconstituted as shown in the following example.</p>\r\n  <pre>\r\n    <pre>public void DeserializationMethod(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext cntx)&#123;<br />  string someData = info.GetString(\"someName\");<br />  // Use input validation techniques to validate this data.<br />&#125;</pre>\r\n  </pre>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
