Review documentation for information about remote logging functionality.</p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Identify the logging subsystem.</strong> The logging subsystem should provide an API that allows generating log entries from application code. If this API or the logging subsystem don't exist, write them. Make a list of functions that may be used to generate log entries.</p>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Review the logging subsystem.</strong> Use the list of logging functions and trace them to determine where the log entries end up. Verify the code exists that sends log entries to a remote log server.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the following steps to implement sending logs to a centralized log server:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Design the logging subsystem.</strong> Design and implement a class or library specifically for logging. When designing the logging subsystem, consider sending logs to a remote log server. Consider the following factors when designing the logging subsystem:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Log throttling<li>Logging important event details<li>Logging important security operations<li>Logging important business operations<li>Monitoring the use of privileged accounts<li>Logging authentication events<li>Avoiding including sensitive information in logs<li>Logging unusual activity</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Choose a protocol for communicating with the log server.</strong> The Internet standard for sending logs remotely is syslog (RFC 5424). It is recommended to use syslog, because it is supported by most centralized logging solutions.</p>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Implement the logging subsystem.</strong> Write code that generates log entries and sends them to a remote log server via your protocol of choice.</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information about the syslog protocol, see <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5424.txt\">http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5424.txt</a></li>\r\n  </ul>"
