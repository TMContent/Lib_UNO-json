This information is also useful for detecting insider attacks.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Use the following steps to verify that the use of privileged accounts is monitored.</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify privileged user roles.</strong> Identify the types of privileged user accounts available in your application. Some example are: administrator, root, power user, manager, etc. Make a list of privileged user roles.</p>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <strong>Identify functionality unique to privileged users.</strong> For each type of privileged user account, make a list of functionality that this type of account can use that&nbsp; a regular user cannot. Some examples are: adding or removing user accounts, changing passwords for other users, changing application settings, shutting down the application, etc. Make a list of functionality that is unique to privileged users.</p>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Identify code that implements functions unique to privileged users.</strong> Use the list of actions available exclusively to privileged users to identify the functions that implement these actions. Make a list of these functions.</p>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Verify that the use of privileged accounts is monitored.</strong>&nbsp;Use the list of functions that implement functionality unique to privileged users to review each one. Verify that each of those functions generates log entries for both successful and failed events.</p>\r\n          </li>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Perform the following actions to implement monitoring the use of privileged user accounts:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify privileged user roles.</strong> Identify the types of privileged user accounts available in your application.
