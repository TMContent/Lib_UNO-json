          "<h1>Applies To</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>What to Check For</h1>\n  <p>Verify that windows authentication is used if it is a viable alternative to ASP.Net Forms Authentication.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>Unlike Forms Authentication, Windows Authentication never transmits a password in plain text or a direct hash of the password over the network. This makes it much more difficult for an attacker to monitor network traffic and steal passwords or to steal a session through a replay attack.</p>\n  <p>In addition, you also benefits a unified identity store, centralized account administration, and enforceable account and password policies. </p>\n  <h1>How To Check</h1>\n  <p>To verify that windows authentication is used:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Verify that IIS is configured for Windows Authentication.</strong> Verify that anonymous access is disabled and integrated Windows authentication is enabled in IIS.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Verify that authentication is configured.</strong>&nbsp;Locate the &lt;<em>authentication</em>&gt; element in your application's <em>Web.config</em> file or in the machine-level <em>Web.config </em>file. Verify that the authentication mode is set to Windows. For example:</p>\n      <pre>...<br />&lt;system.web&gt;<br />&nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &lt;authentication mode=\"Windows\"/&gt;<br />&nbsp; ...<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;<br />...</pre>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>How To Fix</h1>\n  <p>Follow these steps to design and configure your application for Windows Authentication.</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks</strong>. When you configure your web application to use Windows Authentication, Internet Explorer will automatically authenticate using the currently logged-on user's credentials without prompting the user. This is known as \"silent authentication\" and makes your application more susceptible to Cross Site Request Forgery. </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Configure your application for Windows Authentication. </strong>To use Windows authentication in ASP.NET, you must use Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) to disable anonymous access and configure a Windows-based authentication method for your Web application's virtual directory. You must also ensure that the <em>mode</em> attribute on the &lt;<em>authentication</em>&gt; element is set to \"<em>Windows</em>\" (the default setting) in your <em>Web.config</em> file.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <em>You may find these additional articles useful</em>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/article/149c6907-0c10-4386-8f88-c3bfaf626485\">Use Windows Authentication for Web Users if Possible</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>\n  <h1>\n  </h1>\n  <h1>\n  </h1>"
