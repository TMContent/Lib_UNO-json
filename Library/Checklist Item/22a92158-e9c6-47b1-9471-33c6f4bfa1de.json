Incoming packets with an internal address can indicate an intrusion attempt or probe and should be denied entry to the perimeter network. Likewise, set up your router to&nbsp;route outgoing packets only if they have a valid internal IP address. Verifying outgoing packets does not protect you from a denial of service attack, but it does keep such attacks from originating from your network.</p>\n  <p>This type of filtering also enables the originator to be easily traced to its true source since the attacker would have to use a valid &#8212; and legitimately reachable &#8212; source address. </p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information, see \"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial&nbsp;of&nbsp;Service Attacks Which Employ IP Source Address Spoofing\" at <a href=\"http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2267.txt\">http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2267.txt</a>.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
