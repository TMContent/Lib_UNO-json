If the API or the logging subsystem don't exist, write them.

Log both successful and failed events. Use the list of logging APIs when writing code that generates log entries. Use the list of log entry details when writing code that generates log entries to make sure that the log entries include all the relevant information.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
