To reduce the attack surface area, default services that are not required should be shut down. Examples include <b>bootps </b>and <b>Finger</b>, which are rarely required. You should also scan your router to detect which ports are open.</p>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
