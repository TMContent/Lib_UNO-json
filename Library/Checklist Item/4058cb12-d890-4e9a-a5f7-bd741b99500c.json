          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>Check to ensure that your application does not use LogonUser API for creating impersonation token. </p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Avoid writing code that calls the <b>LogonUser</b> API to create impersonation tokens because this forces you to store user names and passwords on your Web server. </p>\r\n  <p>Instead, use a unique application pool with a specific process identity if you need a specific identity to access downstream resources. If you need multiple identities to access a range of downstream resources and services, use Windows Server 2003 protocol transition and the new <b>WindowsIdentity</b> constructor; this allows you to create a Windows token that is given only an account's user principal name (UPN). To access a network resource, you need&nbsp;a delegate-level token. To get this token type, your server needs to be configured as trusted for delegation in Active Directory.</p>\r\n  <p>The following code shows how to use this constructor to obtain a Windows token for a given user.</p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <pre>using System;<br />using System.Security.Principal;<br />public void ConstructToken(string upn, out WindowsPrincipal p)&#123;<br />  WindowsIdentity id = new WindowsIdentity(upn);<br />  p = new WindowsPrincipal(id);<br />&#125;</pre>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An account's UPN is guaranteed to be unique within a forest. Frequently, the UPN is the user's e-mail address, but it does not have to be. A user always has a UPN and by default, it is <i>userlogonname</i>&#64;<i>fullyqualifieddomainname</i>. If you are logged into a domain, you can find your UPN name by running <b>whoami /upn</b> from a command window.</blockquote>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance. </p>"
