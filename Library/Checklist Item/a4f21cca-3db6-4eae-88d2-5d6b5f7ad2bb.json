          "## What to Check For ##\r\n\r\nEnsure the application automatically locks inactive user accounts. Verify that all instances of locking inactive accounts are logged.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nInactive user accounts increase the attack surface of the application and can be used by an attacker as a means of entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Check ##\r\n\r\nFollow these steps during the design phase to make sure your application has the capability to lock its inactive user accounts:\r\n\r\n1. **Verify your application stores the user's last login/inactivity information.** Check if your application has the necessary procedures in place to store and retrieve last login and lockout information about its users. \r\n\r\n2. **Verify your application has a lockout policy.** An account lockout policy is typically application specific. Review your application's requirements and design specifications. Check for the following functionality:\r\n\t- A mechanism for determining user inactivity\r\n\t- A mechanism for locking inactive accounts\r\n\t- A mechanism for unlocking disabled accounts\r\n\t- Verify that the last-login timestamp is reset to the current timestamp upon a successful authentication attempt\r\n\r\n3. **Verify the lockout policy is enforced by default.** Make sure the functionality that enforces the lockout policy is enabled by default during deployment. Ensure that only users with administrative privileges can amend your application's lockout policy. Verify that all instances of modifying the lockout policy are logged.\tCheck the following locations in the code to determine if the lockout policy is fully enforced:\r\n\t- Account administration routines\r\n\t- Background database processes that perform user account maintenance\r\n\t- Authentication routines\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Fix ##\r\n\r\nUse the following steps when locking inactive user accounts:\r\n\r\n1. **Set a lockout policy.** Create the application's lockout policy. Determine the necessary duration of inactivity before an account can be locked/disabled. This policy can vary depending on whether the account is of a normal user or an administrator. For example, disable normal accounts after 45 days of inactivity and administrative accounts after 30 days of inactivity.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep track of user inactivity.** Establish a mechanism to keep track of the last successful authentication. Successful authentication can be tracked via logs or a timestamp, which resides in the user database. \r\n\r\n3. **Set a lockout mechanism.** Establish a mechanism to verify the current period of inactivity and automatically set the disabled bit for inactive accounts. Using the application or database server's scheduler, activate such functionality to run during the hours with least user activity. Keep in mind that inactive accounts should be disabled, but not removed until it is confirmed that they should be completely removed.\r\n"
