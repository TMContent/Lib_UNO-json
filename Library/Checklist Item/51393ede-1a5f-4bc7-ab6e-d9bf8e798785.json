Since the search order will look for DLLs in other locations on the target machine, it may cause the process to load unintended, malicious DLLs. If a malicious DLL is loaded, malicious code will run with the privilege level of the executing process.</p>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Secure the application directory.</strong> Place strong ACLs on the application directory, denying WRITE access to intruders. The &lt;application_name&gt;.local file in the application&#8217;s directory causes the OS to load requested DLLs from that directory, even when absolute paths are used.</p>\n        </li>\n      </li>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/article/4a17b938-80d0-455a-a77f-1b786e3ed90b\">Load Libraries Safely on Windows</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>&nbsp;</h1>"
