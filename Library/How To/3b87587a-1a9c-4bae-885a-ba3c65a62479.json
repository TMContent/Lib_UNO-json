</span>Analyze Causes and Countermeasures</span>\r\n  </h1>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <span>During this step you will be shown the causes behind Cross-Site Request Forgery,<span>&nbsp;</span>how to recognize it within your code base and you will be shown coding best practices, as to avoid this issue altogether.</span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <h2>\r\n    <span>Cross-Site Request Forgery Causes</span>\r\n  </h2>\r\n  <p>\r\n    This kind of vulnerability exists because the web application trusts the forged request.<span>&nbsp;</span>Thus, the cause for this bug is a case of poor or missing authentication code.<span>&nbsp;</span>The application lacks the functionality to verify that every client request is not forged and that it actually originates from a legitimate client action.<span>&nbsp;</span>Web applications vulnerable to CSRF implement a persistent authentication system in which they validate the user against a persistent token such as a session cookie.<span>&nbsp;</span>In persistent authentication, when the server receives a request it only checks if the user is logged in and not if the request comes due to a legitimate client action.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <h2>\r\n    <span>\r\n      Cross-Site Request Forgery Countermeasures\r\n    </span>\r\n  </h2>\r\n  <p>\r\n    The main prevention against CSRF vulnerabilities is to provide a transient authentication system instead of a persistent authentication system.&nbsp;Transient authentication systems verify for the authenticity of every request by using an additional check.<span>&nbsp;</span>One way of doing this is to transmit a secret in every URL; especially require a secret in URLs that request create, update, delete, or mail actions.&nbsp;An attacker will not be able to execute an attack unless he knows the secret.<span>&nbsp;</span>The problem is that an attacker can execute a XSS attack and steal the secret.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    There is no silver bullet against CSRF attacks so developers need to look for ways of raising the bar against attackers.<span>&nbsp;</span>A popular way to protect Internet users from CSRF is by using CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) that require the client to validate the contents of a bitmap image before the application allows any requests.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <span>Other preventions suggested include using POSTs instead of GETs requests to perform actions and or to check the HTTP referrer header.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, both of these countermeasures can be defeated by a knowledgeable attacker since he can easily forge a POST command using a malicious script and can also easily spoof the HTTP referrer.<span>&nbsp;</span></span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <h1>\r\n    <span>Step 3:<span>&nbsp;</span>Start Testing and Exploring</span>\r\n  </h1>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <span>Now that you’ve learned how CSRF attacks work and how to defend against them, this step shows the basic test cases to execute to start testing for CSRF bugs.</span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <b>\r\n      <i>\r\n        <span>\r\n        </span>\r\n      </i>\r\n    </b>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <h2>\r\n    <span>\r\n      Basic Test for Cross-site Request Forgery \r\n    </span>\r\n  </h2>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <span>Follow these test steps to test against CSRF bugs. </span>\r\n    <b>\r\n      <i>\r\n        <span>\r\n        </span>\r\n      </i>\r\n    </b>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <span>Find a web application page that performs an action based on a user request.</span>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <span>Construct a page containing a link or redirect that sends a forged request to the application server.<span>&nbsp;</span>This link usually contains a tag such as an </span>\r\n      <i>\r\n        <span>img</span>\r\n      </i>\r\n      <span> or </span>\r\n      <i>\r\n        <span>iframe</span>\r\n      </i>\r\n      <span> (although mostly any tags can be used) with the source address pointing to the request:<br /></span>\r\n      <font face=\"'Courier New'\">&lt;a href=\"http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=MARIA&amount=100000\"&gt;View my Pictures!&lt;/a&gt;<br />&lt;img src=\"http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=MARIA&amount=100000\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\"&gt;</font>\r\n      <br />Note that the links above will both generate a GET request.
