If an application doesn’t handle another thread or process, modifying or locking the dependant resource at the specific target window of time, it might end up executing undesired behavior.</p>\n  <p>Depending on specific timing, an attacker can access a resource and modify it to change the application's behavior and execute logical attacks on the application or execute denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the target application.</p>\n  <p>Follow these steps to test for race condition bugs in J2EE:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Step 1: Understand attack scenarios </li>\n    <li>Step 2: Analyze causes and countermeasures </li>\n    <li>Step 3: Execute test cases</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>\n    <span>Step 1: Understand Attack Scenarios</span>\n  </h1>\n  <p>First, in order to properly understand how race condition flaws affect J2EE applications, it is recommended to review the common attack scenarios involved:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Logical attacks </li>\n    <li>Denial-of-service attacks</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      <em>Scenario 1:<span>&nbsp; </span>Logical attacks</em>\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>J2EE applications using multithreading might fall victim to logical attacks through race conditions.<span>&nbsp;</span>If developers don’t properly protect static member variables from being modified from a different thread, an attacker can use a different thread to tamper with the value of a static member variable.<span>&nbsp;</span>In some cases, the attacker can actually tamper with a static member at the correct time in order to launch a logical attack on the application.<span></span>This scenario is similar to time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) attacks where a resource is changed by an attacker in between the time it is checked and the time it is used.</p>\n  <p>Consider this code:</p>\n  <pre>1&nbsp; class PriceCalculator()<br />2&nbsp; {<br />3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>static int number_of_coupons = 0;</strong>&nbsp; <br />4<br />5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public int CalculatePrice()<br />6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int balance = 5000;<br />8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int maximum_coupons_allowed = 10;<br />9<br />10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (number_of_coupons &lt; maximum_coupons_allowed) <br />11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int total = balance - 10*number_of_coupons; <br />13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return total;<br />14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0;<br />16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />17<br />18&nbsp;&nbsp;  public void GrabCoupon()<br />19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number_of_coupons++;<br />21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />22<br />23&nbsp; } <br /></pre>\n  <p>\n    <span>\n    </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>The code in the function above looks harmless.<span>&nbsp;</span>However, the <em>number_of_coupons</em> was defined as a static member of a class in line 3.<span>&nbsp;</span>This means that in a multithreading application, a different thread might change the value of the <em>number_of_coupons</em> variable after the instruction in line 10 executes but before executing the instruction in line 12.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>\n  <p>Now notice the following method in the class <em>GrabCoupon </em>that can be used to increase the number of coupons.<span></span>If an attacker can invoke the <em>GrabCoupon</em> method from a different thread, he or she might be able to modify the total price calculated in the <em>CalculatePrice</em> method.<span>&nbsp;</span>For instance, an attacker might discover that a request to the following URL invokes the <em>GrabCoupon</em> method, increasing the <em>number_of_coupons </em>static member variable:</p>\n  <pre>\n    <span>http://some_site/sumbitCoupon?method=GrabCoupon</span>\n  </pre>\n  <p>To launch the attack, the attacker calls the <em>CalculatePrice()</em> function while making repeated requests to the URL above.<span></span>This may cause the <em>number_of_coupons</em> to be less than the maximum allowed at the time of check (line 10) but be larger than the maximum allowed at the time of use (line 12), resulting in the application calculating a lower price than the one expected.</p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      <em>Scenario 2:<span>&nbsp; </span>Denial-of-services (DoS) attacks</em>\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>During this second scenario the application doesn’t need to be multithreaded.<span>&nbsp;</span>The attack scenario consists of an attacker accessing and locking a resource that is dependant&nbsp;on the J2EE application to properly function, such as a critical file or network port.<span></span>If the attacker locks the resource before the J2EE application can access it, he or she causes the application to malfunction, thus creating a denial-of-service scenario.</p>\n  <h1>\n    <span>Step 2: Analyze Causes and Countermeasures</span>\n  </h1>\n  <p>The&nbsp;second step in learning how to test for race condition bugs in J2EE is to understand what causes them and how to protect against them.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will help you to identify this bug in code as well as to prepare you for executing the necessary test cases.</p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      <em>References to static members of classes</em>\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>A common cause for race condition bugs is to allow static members of a class to be changed in between time of check and time of use (TOCTOU).<span></span>This cause is what allows the first scenario in which the attacker logically attacks the application by changing the static member <em>number_of_coupons</em> in between TOCTOU.<span>&nbsp;</span>To prevent race condition attacks using this scenario, developers can refrain from defining static members of classes and use local variables inside functions and methods:</p>\n  <pre>1&nbsp; class PriceCalculator()<br />2&nbsp; {<br />3<br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public int CalculatePrice()<br />5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  {<br />6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>int number_of_coupons = GetCouponCount();&nbsp; </strong><br />7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int balance = 5000;<br />8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int maximum_coupons_allowed = 10;<br />9<br />10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (number_of_coupons &lt; maximum_coupons_allowed) <br />11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  {<br />12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int total = balance - 10*number_of_coupons; <br />13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return total;<br />14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  }<br />15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0;<br />16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />17<br />18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

} </pre>\n  <p>\n    <span>\n    </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>Now the J2EE application defines <em>number_of_coupons</em> inside a method so the local variables exist in the stack of each thread and will not be shared across threads, preventing attackers from modifying a shared version of the variable to execute the attack.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>If developers must use static member variables, they can add a lock in between time of check and time of use to avoid race condition attacks:</p>\n  <pre>1&nbsp; class PriceCalculator()<br />2&nbsp; {<br />3<br />4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static int number_of_coupons = 0;&nbsp; <br />5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object lock = new Object(); <br />6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
