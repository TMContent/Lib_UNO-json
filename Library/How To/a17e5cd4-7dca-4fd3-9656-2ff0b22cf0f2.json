Where possible, you should avoid this approach because an attacker who manages to inject code and compromise your Web application will have unrestricted capabilities on the local computer.</p>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information, see &#8220;Delegation and Impersonation with WCF&#8221; at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730088.aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730088.aspx</a><li>For impersonation and delegation Q&A, see the Impersonation/Delegation section of &#8220;WCF 3.5 Questions and Answers&#8220; at <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurityGuide\">http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurityGuide</a></li></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
