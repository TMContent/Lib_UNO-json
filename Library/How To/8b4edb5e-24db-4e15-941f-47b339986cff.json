          "<h1>Description</h1>\r\n  <p>The safe C Runtime (CRT) libraries are updated versions of the standard C and C&#43;&#43; libraries, including the CRT Library, Standard C&#43;&#43; Library (SCL), Active Template Library (ATL), and Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). The updates are designed to help protect applications compiled with Visual C&#43;&#43;. They add appropriate buffer checks to functions that are known to be vulnerable to attack; they validate parameters; and they deprecate other functions, such as <b>strcpy</b>, which are known to be vulnerable to attack. </p>\r\n  <p>Use the secure version of a function if it exists. If a new secure function exists, the older, less secure version is marked as deprecated and the new version has the <b>_s</b> (secure) suffix. For example, use <b>strcpy_s</b> instead of <b>strcpy</b>. Note that the compiler will generate a warning if you use a deprecated function. </p>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For a list of secure CRT functions, see \"Security-Enhanced Versions of CRT Functions\" at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wd3wzwts(en-US,VS.80).aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wd3wzwts(en-US,VS.80).aspx</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
