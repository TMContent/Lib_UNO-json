Temporary certificates are easier to generate and cost less money than a certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority so they are well suited for a development environment.</p>\r\n  <p>To create a temporary X.509 certificate in development environment use the MakeCert utility. In a production environment use an X.509 certificate issued by a Certificate Authority such as VeriSign.</p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Note</strong>: Do not use temporary development certificates in a production environment as this will open your communication channel to malicious spoofing, sniffing and tampering.</p>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information see &#8220;How to Create and Install Temporary Certificates in WCF for Message Security During Development&#8221; and &#8220;How to Create and Install Temporary Certificates in WCF for Transport Security during Development&#8221; at <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurityGuide/\">http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurityGuide/</a><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurity/Wiki/View.aspx?title=How&#37;20Tos&referringTitle=Home\"></a><li>For more information on how to create a certificate, see &#8220;Certificate Creation Tool&#8221; at <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bfsktky3(VS.80).aspx\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bfsktky3(VS.80).aspx</a></li></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <hr />\r\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
