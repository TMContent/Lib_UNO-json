</span></p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>In detail:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>The attacker gains access to a password file or a network capture showing a hashed or encrypted version of the target password and the cryptographic algorithm used to hash/encrypt the value.</li>\n    <li>The attacker constructs the attack dictionary consisting of possible password values.</li>\n    <li>For each entry in the attack dictionary the attacker:</li>\n  </ol>\n  <ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>hashes or encrypts the entry using the algorithm discovered in step 2.</li>\n      <li>compares the hashed/encrypted password with the target password from step 1.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </ul>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h1>\n    <span>Step 2: Analyze Causes and Countermeasures</span>\n  </h1>\n  <p>Next, it is necessary to understand what causes dictionary attacks and how to countermeasure them.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      <em>Attack causes</em>\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>Cryptographic dictionary attacks exist by design.<span></span>This issue cannot be identified in code since it’s an attack method rather than an implementation flaw.<span>&nbsp; </span>In most cases attackers will have access to the decryption function as well as the ciphertext.<span></span>These are the only two requirements to start a dictionary attack and, since developers are encouraged to use a public cryptographic algorithm instead of implementing their own, this attack is innate in cryptographic applications which follow security best practices.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      <em>Attack countermeasures</em>\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>For cryptanalytic dictionary attacks that target recovering a key rather than a password, choosing a large enough key reduces the likelihood of the decryption key being found by a dictionary attack.<span></span>Applications that implement cryptography use keys of a certain length (measured in bits) that determines the possible keys combinations -or key space.<span></span>For instance, a 64-bit key has 2^64possible key combinations.<span></span>The larger the decryption key the more difficult to construct a dictionary that includes it.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>\n  <p>To protect against dictionary attacks on passwords, or similar variations such as attacks through OS password files, it is recommended to avoid using words available in dictionaries or common variation of dictionary words or names such as “h0us3” for “house” or “3ric” for “Eric”.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applications must enforce a strong-password policy with complexity requirements that limit the chances of passwords existing in attack dictionaries. Additional ways to countermeasure <i>credential</i> dictionary attacks such as using locking down accounts, introducing time delays to the log in process, asking for human interaction proofs such as CAPTCHAs or secret questions, or executing different behaviors after a number of failed attempts.<span></span>Note that these countermeasures are only applicable to credential dictionary attacks and not for cryptographic attacks.<span></span><br /></p>\n  <h1>\n    <span>Step 3: Execute Test Cases</span>\n  </h1>\n  <p>Now that you’ve reviewed the theoretical aspects of dictionary attacks this step focuses at executing practical test cases to check if your application is vulnerable to this attack.</p>\n  <h2>\n    <em>Test for Cryptographic Dictionary Attack (Known-Plaintext)</em>\n  </h2>\n  <p>Follow these steps to test for dictionary attacks using a known-plain text attack:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Build a dictionary list containing a set of possible decryptions keys.</li>\n    <li>Discover a ciphertext <i>C </i>and its corresponding plaintext <i>P</i>, as well as the decryption function that was used to decrypt the plaintext using the unknown decryption key <i>K</i>:<span>&nbsp;
