</span></span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <span>In the example below, the attacker now logs in with a valid account (</span>\n    <span>\n      <i>johns</i>\n    </span>\n    <span>) and tries to steal the password of another user.<span>&nbsp;</span>The attacker passes this attack string to check if the password for the third user in the document tree (</span>\n    <span>\n      <i>mrt</i>\n    </span>\n    <span>) starts with an&nbsp;</span>\n    <span>\n      <i>a</i>\n    </span>\n    <span>:</span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <font face=\"'Courier New'\">johns' and substring((//user[position()=3]/child::node()[position()=2]),1,1)=\"a\" and '1' = '1</font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <span>The resulting XPath query looks the one below (note that the attacker needs to pass his valid username and password). The statement only returns true if the </span>\n    <span>\n      <i>substring()</i>\n    </span>\n    <span> condition is true:<span>&nbsp;</span></span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <font face=\"'Courier New'\">/users/user[username/text()='johns' and substring((//user[position()=3]/child::node()[position()=2]),1,1)=\"a\" and '1' = '1' and password/text()='abc123']</font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The attacker can craft similar blind commands to check data lengths using \n    <i>string-length()</i>.\nFor instance, the next query returns true if the length of the target password is 7:</p>\n  <p>\n    <font face=\"'Courier New'\">/users/user[username/text()='johns' and string-length(//user[position()=3]/child::node()[position()=2]) and '1' = '1' and password/text()='abc123']</font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The attacker can use additional functions such as \n    <i>count()</i>, <i>contains()</i>\n     to reveal both the contents of an XML store as well as its structure.&nbsp;Exploring the logic and hierarchy of an XML document is known as XML Crawling.&nbsp;</p>\n  <h1>\n    <span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp; </span>Analyze Causes and Countermeasures</span>\n  </h1>\n  <p>\n    <span>The following step in testing for XPath Injection bugs is to understand what causes them and how to defend against them.</span>\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      XPath Injection Cause\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n    <span>XPath Injection bugs exist due to poor input validation on and failing to sanitize the parameters used in an XPath query.<span>&nbsp;</span>For example, consider the following PHP code:</span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <font face=\"'Courier New'\">&lt;?php<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;$xml = simplexml_load_file(\"users.xml\");<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;$result = $xml-&gt;xpath(\"//users/user[username/text()='\". $_GET['name'] . \"']\");<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;print_r($result);<br />?&gt;</font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <span>The PHP application uses the value passed in the URL parameter </span>\n    <span>name</span>\n    <span> in the XPath query without checking for injected commands.&nbsp;</span>Make sure to look at the API functions that your application uses to execute XPath queries.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>\n    <span>\n    </span>\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      XPath Injection Countermeasures\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n    <span>XPath Injection vulnerabilities can be prevented by sanitizing user input.<span>&nbsp;</span>Specifically, the application needs to disallow any single or double quotes inputted by a user from making it to an XPath query.<span>&nbsp;</span>Sometimes the input doesn’t come directly from the user but is read from a persistent data source such as a database or an environment variable.&nbsp;In these cases, the application must sanitize the data coming from the data source and into the XPath query.&nbsp;</span>A proposed method consists of escaping any single quotes.&nbsp;Other methods include using parameterized XPath queries to properly handle user input.</p>\n  <h1>\n    <span>Step 3:<span>&nbsp;</span>Start Testing and Exploring</span>\n  </h1>\n  <p>\n    <span>Now that you are familiar with the inner workings of XPath injection attacks and able to recognize both its causes and countermeasures,<span>&nbsp;</span>you must continue by executing basic XPath Injection black box test cases and exploring the results.</span>\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      Start with a simple test string\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n    <span>Almost all XPath Injection strings must contain either a single or a double quote.<span>&nbsp;</span>Your first test pass must consist of submitting a string containing quotes to see how the application reacts to it:</span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <font face=\"'Courier New'\">abc'xyz\"</font>\n  </p>\n  <p>If the server doesn’t return an error message and uses this string for an XPath query, it is almost certain that you’ll find an XPath Injection bug.&nbsp;</p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      Testing for Normal XPath Injection Authentication Bypass \n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n    <span>Hardware Requirements:<span>&nbsp;</span>One client computer

proper test case coverage, you must submit tests cases through different application entry points and adapt the format of the test data depending on the data format required for each entry point and each type of attack that can be carried out.<span>&nbsp;</span></span>\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      Tune test case data format according to entry points\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n    <span>Like when testing for any injection bug, it is important that you adapt the data used in test cases according to the entry point under test.<span>&nbsp;</span>For example, when testing through URL parameters, the first string might look like the second or the third depending on the URL-encoding schema:</span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <font face=\"'Courier New'\">user' or '1' = '1 -&nbsp;original test string<br />user'+or+'1'+=+'1 -&nbsp;string under URL encoding schema 1<br />user'%20or%20'1'%20=%20'1 - string under URL encoding schema 2</font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <span>You must consider tuning the test case format for different entry points below such as URL parameters, web form fields, web services methods, flash parameters, etc.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h2>\n    <span>\n      Fine-tune test case data according to different attack objectives\n    </span>\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n    <span>Finally, you must consider the different variations and constructs depending on the attack objective
