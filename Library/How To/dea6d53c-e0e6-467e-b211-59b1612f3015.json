As opposed to hub networks, a network node sniffing packets in promiscuous mode will not be able to monitor the traffic between another two nodes in a switched network. ARP Poisoning attacks are specific to switched networks and exist by default. Switched networks work by sending ARP requests and receiving ARP replies.<span></span>The problem and root cause of this bug is that this protocol is stateless. A network node doesn’t check that an ARP reply actually comes as a reply from a legitimate ARP request. It just assumes that all ARP requests are legitimate giving room to ARP poisoning attacks.<span></span></span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <h2>\r\n    <span>\r\n      ARP Poisoning Countermeasures\r\n    </span>\r\n  </h2>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <span>ARP poisoning can’t be totally prevented but can be mitigated.<span></span>A way of doing this is to have static ARP tables so that any changes in the ARP tables are disallowed.<span></span>However, this is impractical in large or rapidly changing networks.<span></span>A more reliable countermeasure consists of proactively denying ARP packets in a switched network. This method known as DHCP Snooping’s ARP Security, or Dynamic ARP Inspection, enforces a network policy that disallows any ARP packets to be forwarded if the source IP (Source Protocol Address field) is not genuine.</span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Additional ARP poisoning detection and prevention tools are available in the Internet.<span></span>For instance, Unix-based <i>Arpwatch </i>sends an email notification as soon as an ARP cache entry changes or Windows-based <i>XArp </i>also offers configuration options to intercept any malicious ARP packets. Finally, it is also possible to configure Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to add rules to protect against ARP spoofing attacks.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <h1>\r\n    <span>Step 3:<span></span>Start Testing and Exploring</span>\r\n  </h1>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <span>Now that you’ve learned ARP Poisoning attack scenarios, why are they caused, and how to defend against them, this guides on how to execute ARP poisoning basic test cases.</span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <h2>\r\n    <span>\r\n      Test for ARP Poisoning to Sniff Network Traffic\r\n    </span>\r\n  </h2>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <span>To test for ARP poisoning for network sniffing you will need two boxes (a victim and an attacker) in the same network and a gateway box.<span></span>Follow these steps:</span>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Download and install <i>Cain </i>and <i>Wireshark </i>on the attacker’s box.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Run <i>Cain</i>. \r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Click <i>Configure </i>in the menu and select the network interface (can be wireless interface).\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Click on the <i>Sniffer </i>tab and the <i>Hosts </i>sub tab.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <span>Start the sniffer and click the plus (+) sign.</span>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <span>Select a range of IPs to scan their MAC (include the target box in the range) and click OK.<span></span>Both the gateway and victim IPs (and their MACs) should appear in the hosts list.</span>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Click the <i>ARP poisoning </i>sub tab.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <span>Click on the plus sign and add an ARP route from the victim to the gateway.</span>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Start ARP poisoning by pressing the <i>ARP </i>button.<span></span>As soon as the victim becomes active its status changes from “<i>idle</i>” to “<i>poisoning</i>”.<span></span>The lower pane starts showing the packets being intercepted.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Start <i>Wireshark </i>and start capturing network traffic in the same interface selected in <i>Cain</i>.\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <span>Expected results: </span>The first check you can to see if the ARP attack was successful do is running the <i>arp -a</i> command in the victim box (or its Unix equivalent).
