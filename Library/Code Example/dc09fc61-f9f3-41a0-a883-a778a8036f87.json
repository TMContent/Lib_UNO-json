The \"<em>Secure</em>\" and \"<em>HttpOnly</em>\" cookie flags may be set within the ASP.net web.config file for the specific site in consideration. When relying on the ASP.NET built-in session object it is important to ensure both application and application server cookies operate similarly. As such the following code sample from a <em>Web.Config</em> demonstrates setting the ASP.NET session identifier with the \"<em>Secure</em>\" mode and \"<em>HttpOnly</em>\" cookie flags:</p>\n  <pre>   &lt;!-- The following configuration entry ensures that the ASP.NET session identifier is set<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within the context of a specified domain (ensure that the domain is a fully qualified host<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whenever possible.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; httpOnlyCookies ensures that cookies are unavailable to client script code <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (JavaScript/VBScript). This functionality is provided by newer web browser software<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including Internet Explorer 6 and above<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requireSSL ensures that the ASP.NET session cookie is not transmitted in the clear when<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a user accesses the site via the plaintext HTTP instance of the site. --&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;httpCookies domain=\"codesamples.microsoft.com\"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; httpOnlyCookies=\"true\"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requireSSL=\"true\"/&gt;</pre>\n  <br />\n  <hr />\n  <p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns & practices guidance.</p>"
