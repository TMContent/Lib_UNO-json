The \"secure\" and \"httponly\" cookie flags may be set within the ASP.net web.config file for the specific site in consideration. When relying on the ASP.NET built-in session object it is important to ensure both application and application server cookies operate similarly. As such the following code sample from a web.config demonstrates setting the ASP.NET session identifier with the \"secure\" mode and \"httponly\" cookie flags:</p>\n  <pre>   &lt;!-- The following configuration entry ensures that the ASP.NET session identifier is set<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within the context of a specified domain (ensure that the domain is a fully qualified host<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whenever possible.</pre>\n  <pre>\n    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; httpOnlyCookies ensures that cookies are unavailable to client script code <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (JavaScript/VBScript).
