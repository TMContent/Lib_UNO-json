It expires when the user closes the web browser.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>If you need a functional timeout for a specific application, just store a timestamp into the user Session and use it however your application needs (e.g. for a maximum session duration, maxmimum inactivity duration, etc.). <a href=\"https://github.com/jroper/play-security-utils/\">This</a> link explains how to add session timeout functionality to the application.&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information about the&nbsp;method, please see<a href=\"http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html#setMaxInactiveInterval%28int%29\">:</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/jroper/play-security-utils/blob/master/src/main/scala/play/security/utils/SessionTimeoutAction.scala\">https://github.com/jroper/play-security-utils/blob/master/src/main/scala/play/security/utils/SessionTimeoutAction.scala</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <div>\n    <br />\n  </div>"
