          "## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nMask all password fields - use input controls that hide user input for password fields by covering user input with a \"mask\", typically a character, such as \"*\". When a user enters a password \"password\", the masked field may look like \"********\".\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nMasking password fields helps protect user passwords from someone that may be looking at their screen.\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\nTo mask all password fields:\r\n\r\n1. **Identify all password-type fields in the application.** Review all the pages in the application to find all password-type fields. Password-type fields include secret answers, CVV, PIN, and other data, which is equivalent to passwords.\r\n2. **Use password fields that mask user input.** Use whatever mechanism is practical to mask the entered passwords. For web applications, this can be done by using the `password` input type, like so:\r\n\r\n        <form>\r\n        ...\r\n        <input type=\"password\" name=\"pass\" AUTOCOMPLETE=\"off\"/>\r\n        ...\r\n        </form>\r\n"
