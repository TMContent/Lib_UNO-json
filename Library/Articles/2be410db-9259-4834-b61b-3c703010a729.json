Ending the session helps prevent hijacking.\r\n\r\n==How to Check==\r\n\r\nTo verify that all pages that use authentication have logout links:\r\n\r\n# **Identify all pages that use authentication.** Make a list of all pages on your site that use authentication.\r\n# **Verify the presence of logout links.** Examine each page that uses authentication to make sure it has a logout link in a location that can be found intuitively.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo place a logout link on each page that uses authentication:\r\n\r\n# **Identify all pages that use authentication.** Make a list of all pages on your site that use authentication.\r\n# **Add logout links.** Add a logout link to each page that uses authentication."
