          "==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that all pages that use authentication have logout links.\n\n==Why==\n\nPlacing a logout link on every page that requires authentication helps the user end the session when he is done with the site. Ending the session helps prevent hijacking.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that all pages that use authentication have logout links:\n\n# **Identify all pages that use authentication.** Make a list of all pages on your site that use authentication.\n# **Verify the presence of logout links.** Examine each page that uses authentication to make sure it has a logout link in a location that can be found intuitively.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo place a logout link on each page that uses authentication:\n\n# **Identify all pages that use authentication.** Make a list of all pages on your site that use authentication.\n# **Add logout links.** Add a logout link to each page that uses authentication."
