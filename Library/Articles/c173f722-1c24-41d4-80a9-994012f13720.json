          "==Applies To==\n\n* ASP.NET 4.0\n\n==What to Do==\n\nDisable dangerous functions by default.\n\n==Why==\n\nDisable dangerous functions by default so that attackers do not abuse them.\n\n==How==\n\nTo disable dangerous functions by default:\n\n# **Identify code that implements dangerous functions.** Determine which application features implemented by your application might be dangerous. Some examples are: file uploads, code execution, direct database access, and data deletion. Make a spreadsheet about all code that implements dangerous features.\n# **Make dangerous functions configurable.** Modify each piece of code that implements a dangerous function to check application settings to see whether the user has explicitly enabled the dangerous feature. Only allow a dangerous feature to be executed if the user has explicitly enabled it.\n# **Disable dangerous functions by default.** For each dangerous feature, write code so that the feature can only be executed if it has been explicitly enabled by the user.\n# **Document the dangerous functions.** Add information about all the dangerous features to the documentation. Explain why each feature is dangerous. Describe how to configure each feature.\n\n"
