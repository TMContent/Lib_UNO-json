Make sure that the certificates are valid for that server.\r\n# **Verify that TLS is configured on the server.** Examine the configuration of the server that is hosting the Web Services and make sure that Web Services are setup to only be acceptable over TLS encrypted connections.\r\n# **Verify that client code connects to Web Services using TLS.** Examine the client-side code of the application that uses the Web Services. Make sure that the application only uses TLS protected connections to connect to the Web Services.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo use TLS to protect Web Service connections:\r\n\r\n# **Get valid certificates.** Provision valid certificates for the server hosting the Web Services.\r\n# **Set up TLS on the server.** Configure the server to use TLS for the Web Services. Don't allow unencrypted connections to the Web Services â€“ don't bind Web Services to ports that don't use TLS.\r\n# **Update client code to use TLS.** Change client code to connect to the Web Services using the port that uses TLS.\r\n"
