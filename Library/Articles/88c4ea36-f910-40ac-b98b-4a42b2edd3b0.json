          "==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that TLS is used to protect Web Service connections.\n\n==Why==\n\nProtect Web Service connections using TLS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that TLS is used to protect Web Service connections:\n\n# **Make sure that valid certificates are present.** Examine the certificates that are present on the server that is hosting the Web Services. Make sure that the certificates are valid for that server.\n# **Verify that TLS is configured on the server.** Examine the configuration of the server that is hosting the Web Services and make sure that Web Services are setup to only be acceptable over TLS encrypted connections.\n# **Verify that client code connects to Web Services using TLS.** Examine the client-side code of the application that uses the Web Services. Make sure that the application only uses TLS protected connections to connect to the Web Services.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo use TLS to protect Web Service connections:\n\n# **Get valid certificates.** Provision valid certificates for the server hosting the Web Services.\n# **Set up TLS on the server.** Configure the server to use TLS for the Web Services. Don't allow unencrypted connections to the Web Services â€“ don't bind Web Services to ports that don't use TLS.\n# **Update client code to use TLS.** Change client code to connect to the Web Services using the port that uses TLS.\n"
