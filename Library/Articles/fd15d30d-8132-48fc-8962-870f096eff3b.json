Do not store PINs, verification codes, or full track contents to prevent this data from becoming available to attackers even if the system is completely compromised.\r\n\r\n==How to Check==\r\n\r\nTo verify that PINs, verification codes, and full track contents are not stored:\r\n\r\n# **Identify code that handles PINs, verification codes, and full track contents.** Make a spreadsheet of all the code that handles PINs, verification codes and full track contents.\r\n# **Examine code that handles particularly sensitive cardholder data.** Examine each piece of code that handles PINs, verification codes and full track contents to make sure that such information is never stored.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo avoid storing PINs, verification codes, or full track contents:\r\n\r\n# **Identify code that handles PINs, verification codes, and full track contents.** Make a spreadsheet of all the code that handles PINs, verification codes and full track contents.\r\n# **Examine code that handles particularly sensitive cardholder data.** Examine each piece of code that handles PINs, verification codes and full track contents to make sure that such information is never stored.\r\n# **Remove code that stores PINs, verification codes, or full track contents.** If there is code that stores such sensitive information, remove it."
