Make sure that the certificates are valid for that server.\r\n# **Verify that SSL/TLS is configured on the server.** Examine the configuration of the server that is hosting the Web Services and make sure that Web Services are setup to only be acceptable over SSL/TLS encrypted connections.\r\n# **Verify that client code connects to Web Services using SSL/TLS.** Examine the client-side code of the application that uses the Web Services. Make sure that the application only uses SSL/TLS protected connections to connect to the Web Services.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo use SSL/TLS to protect Web Service connections:\r\n\r\n# **Get valid certificates.** Provision valid certificates for the server hosting the Web Services.\r\n# **Set up SSL/TLS on the server.** Configure the server to use SSL/TLS for the Web Services. Don't allow unencrypted connections to the Web Services â€“ don't bind Web Services to ports that don't use SSL/TLS.\r\n# **Update client code to use SSL/TLS.** Change client code to connect to the Web Services using the port that uses SSL/TLS.\r\n"
