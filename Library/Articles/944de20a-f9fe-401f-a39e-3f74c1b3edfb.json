The value of the HTTP referrer filed can be easily changed by the client creating vulnerablities.\r\n\r\n==When==\r\n\r\nWhen making any security decisions, don't rely on the Header information.\r\n\r\n==How==\r\n\r\nHTTP headers are sent at the start of HTTP requests and HTTP responses. Your Web application should make sure it does not base any security decision on information in the HTTP headers because it is easy for an attacker to manipulate the header. For example, the referer field in the header contains the URL of the Web page from where the request originated. Do not make any security decisions based on the value of the referer field, for example, to check whether the request originated from a page generated by the Web application, because the field is easily falsified.
