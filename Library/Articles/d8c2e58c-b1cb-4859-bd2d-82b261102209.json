          "=Description\n\nApplications use connection strings to specify credentials used to access databases. One way to handle connection strings is to hard-code them into the application. This approach is not secure, because anyone with access to the application code is able to recover these connection strings. Once an attacker has recovered the connection strings, they can use them to access the database(s). \n\n=Impact\n\nOnce the attacker has the database access credentials, they might be able to connect to the database and execute arbitrary queries. The privileges granted to the attacker will be based on the access level of the credentials. Typically, the attacker is then able to retrieve, modify, and delete any data in the database, and modify database structure. Having this level of control over the database usually allows the attacker to take full control of the application. If the attacker is able to leverage additional vulnerabilities, or if the servers are not configured securely, the attacker can also take full control of the application server and the database server.\n\n=Countermeasures\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, store connection strings in protected configuration files. \n\nStore connection strings in protected configuration files:\n\n* [[612e1d5c-8b41-43ef-a203-daa6f814c57b|Encrypt SQL Connection Strings with DPAPI]]\n* [[b42bbac5-7441-436a-92a5-a0d05593c62c|Encrypt SQL Connection Strings with RSA on Web Farms]]\n\n=Application Check\n\nTo check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, examine all code that uses the database and ensure that connections strings are stored in protected configuration files.\n\nConnection strings are stored in protected configuration files:\n\n* [[eb8d54d3-1d59-4d33-ba54-b69df5d2eb74|Connection Strings Are Encrypted]]"
