          "==Applies To==\n\n* Web Applications\n* Server-side\n\n==What to Do==\n\nCentralize authentication controls.\n\n==Why==\n\nImplementing a single set of centralized authentication controls helps implement them correctly, use them correctly in the application, and manage them later on.\n\n==How==\n\nTo centralize authentication controls:\n\n# **Identify application requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls:\n## Authentication should be required for all private pages.\n## All password fields should be masked.\n## Accounts should be locked after multiple failed authentication attempts.\n## Authentication should be implemented on the server-side.\n## Authentication controls should be centralized.\n## Authentication controls should fail securely.\n## Strong authentication credentials (passwords) should be enforced.\n## Account management functions should be protected.\n## User credential (password) changing functions should be protected.\n## Re-authentication should be required for sensitive operations.\n## Authentication credentials (passwords) should expire.\n## Authentication events should be logged.\n## Authentication attempts should be throttled.\n## Passwords should be hashed and salted.\n## Authentication credentials (connection strings) for external resources should be protected.\n## Authentication with external services.\n# **Define authentication control APIs.** Make the exposed APIs simple to use for developers. Define authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements. Include functionality to authenticate with external services.\n# **Implement and document authentication controls.** Implement and document authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements. \n# **Use authentication controls in the application.** Developers should use the centralized authentication controls whenever authentication is necessary.\n"
