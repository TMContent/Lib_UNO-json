Define authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements. Include functionality to authenticate with external services.\r\n# **Implement and document authentication controls.** Implement and document authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements. \r\n# **Use authentication controls in the application.** Developers should use the centralized authentication controls whenever authentication is necessary.\r\n"
