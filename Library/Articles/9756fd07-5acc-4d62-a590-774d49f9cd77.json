          "==What to Do==\n\nRemove all test accounts from applications before deployment.\n\n\n==Why==\n\nTest accounts provide access to the application's functionality during development. Since they are often poorly secured, they are a common target for attackers.\n\n\n==How==\n\nTo remove all test accounts from applications before deployment:\n\n# **Enumerate all accounts.** List all the users to your application. This should be a full comprehensive list that includes, but is not limited to, active users, inactive users, users pending confirmation, and test accounts.\n# **Identify their use.** Examine the use/status of each account. Sort the accounts into groups according to their use/status.\n# **Remove the accounts that will no longer be used.** Once the accounts are sorted into groups, list all accounts that are used for test purposes. After identifying all test accounts, remove them from your application's database.\n# **Enforce strong passwords on the remaining accounts.** After removing all test accounts, enforce strong passwords for the remaining accounts in your application. Strong passwords decrease the probability of compromising valid users.\n\n"
