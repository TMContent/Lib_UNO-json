At the very least, there should be an administration panel for managing user accounts, and a page for users to manage their own accounts.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Make authentication and authorization code configurable.</strong>&nbsp;Find all code responsible for authentication and authorization features. Modify this code to read settings defined in the application requirements.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Design the administrative pages.</strong>&nbsp;Design the pages to be used for configuring access control and authentication policies based on the requirements for your application.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Implement the administration interface.&nbsp;</strong>Write code for the administrative pages to interface with authentication and authorization code. The administration interface should be able to read and write settings to a secure location, where the authentication and authorization code may access them. The saved settings should be protected with access controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure and tampering.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <br />"
