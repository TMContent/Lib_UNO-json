          "==What to Do==\n\nRemove test data before deployment. \n\n\n==Why==\n\nRemove test data from the application before deployment. This data may disclose information about the workings of the application and may assist attackers with compromising the system.\n\n\n==How==\n\nTo remove test data from the application before deployment:\n\n# **Identify data stores used by the application.** Make a spreadsheet of all the places that are used by the application to store data.\n# **Examine data stores used by the application.** Before deploying the application, examine each place where the application stores data and check for the presence of test data.\n# **Remove all test data from the application.** Remove any test data that has been found before deploying the application.\n"
