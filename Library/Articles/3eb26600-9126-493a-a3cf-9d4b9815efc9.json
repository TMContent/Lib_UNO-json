Search your code for calls to these functions in order to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.\r\n# **Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is validated.** Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is passed through positive validation routines before being included in HTTP response headers.\r\n# **Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded.** Identify functions provided by your platform to URL-encode data. Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is URL-encoded (using the functions that URL-encode data) before being included in HTTP response headers.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo URL-encode data in HTTP Response headers: \r\n\r\n# **Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.** Identify the functions that are provided by your platform to include data in HTTP response headers.
