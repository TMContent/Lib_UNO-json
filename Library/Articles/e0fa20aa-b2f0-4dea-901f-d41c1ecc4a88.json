          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* Google Android applications that use an instance of the //WebView// class to process sensitive or personal information.\r\n\r\n==What to Do==\r\n\r\nWhen using the //WebView// class, call the //clearCache()// method after a session finishes to remove any sensitive information from the cache.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nYour application maintains its own cache for cookies and session information. If users access a //WebView// that allows sensitive information to enter the cache, clear the cache database to prevent information leakage.\r\n\r\n==When==\r\n\r\nWhen accessing sensitive information in a //WebView//.\r\n\r\n==How==\r\n\r\nTo clear sensitive information from cache:\r\n\r\n# **Call the clearCache() method.** After initializing a reference to the //WebView// (i.e., //myWebView//), call the //clearCache()// method: //final WebView myWebView = (WebView) findViewById (R.id.webView_name); myWebView.clearCache (boolean includeDiskFiles);// Typically include true on the //clearCache()// method to wipe any cache files on the drive. Call this method in the activities’ //onPause()// or //onDestroy()// method to ensure that the cache data is removed upon exiting the application. Note that doing so could cause a performance issue if the screen is reoriented during use and the site must reload the //onResume()// method for the activity, call //myWebView.reload()// so that the user does not have to reinitiate the URL load.\r\n# **Clear the cache database.** You can also call //getApplicationContext().deleteDatabase(web.getSettings().getDatabasePath())// to completely delete the cache database. However, this should be unnecessary if the cache files are properly deleted.\r\n# **Disable loading data from the cache.** Enforce no loading from the cache on a //WebView//. When creating the //WebView//, invoke: //myWebView.getSettings().setCacheMode(WebSettings.LOAD_NO_CACHE);//\r\nNote that this call only prevents loading from the cache and does not prevent or clear cached data.\r\n\r\n==Problem Example==\r\n\r\nAs the MyApp developer, you are using a //WebView// to allow users to purchase items off the company’s auctioning website. The application uses cookies that contain personal information.\r\n\r\nYou clear the cache each time a user clicks a button to load the page. You use an //onClick// listener with the following code:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nprivate static final String WEB_SITE = www.myapp.com;\r\n\r\npublic void onClick(View v) {\t\t\t\r\n  myWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(false);\r\n  myWeb.loadUrl(WEB_SITE);\r\n  myWeb.clearCache(true);\r\n}\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nTo continually refresh the page content with new auction updates, you instantiate a thread that calls //myWeb.reload()// every 60 seconds. A few months after running this code in production, a user loses his Android device. During an incident investigation, the development team discovers that cached data, including the user’s personal information, is still resident in the application’s cache database.\r\n\r\n==Solution Example==\r\n\r\nYou made the mistake of not clearing the cache each time a user left the application. Although the //clearCache// method was enforced each time a user-initiated URL lookup occurred, the thread reloading the application continued to create cached data.\r\nTo remedy this, create two methods within the activity:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\npublic void onResume() {\r\n  super.onResume();\r\n  if (myWeb!=null) {web.reload();}\r\n}\r\n\t\r\npublic void onDestroy() {\r\n  super.onDestroy();\r\n  web.clearCache(true);\r\n}\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nThis code allows the application to clear the cache for each user session.\r\n"
