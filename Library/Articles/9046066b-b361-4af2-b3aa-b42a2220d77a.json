If a user account is not protected with at least a password, an attacker will be able to easily use that account.\r\n\r\n\r\n==How to Check==\r\n\r\nTo verify that authentication is required for all users:\r\n\r\n# **Identify authentication code.** Make a spreadsheet about the code that implements authentication in the application.\r\n# **Make sure authentication is required for all users.** Examine authentication code to verify that all user accounts require at least a password to login. Check for any special hard-coded user accounts that might not need credentials to login. These types of accounts should not be present.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo force authentication for all users:\r\n\r\n# **Identify authentication code.** Make a spreadsheet about the code that implements authentication in the application.\r\n# **Require authentication for all users.** If it doesn't already require authentication for all users, modify authentication code so that at least a password is required for successful authentication for all users. Remove code that implements any special hard-coded user accounts that don't require authentication.\r\n"
