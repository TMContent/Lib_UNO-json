          "==Applies To==\n\n* ASP.NET 4.0\n\n==What to Do==\n\nDon't use WS-Routing. If you need this functionality, use WS-Addressing instead and protect Web Service connections using SSL/TLS.\n\n==Why==\n\nDon't use WS-Routing, because WS-Routing is vulnerable to routing detour attacks. The WS-Routing protocol doesn't have sufficient security features, so it should be avoided. \n\n==How==\n\nTo avoid using WS-Routing:\n\n# **Find code that uses WS-Routing.** Ask developers whether the application actually uses WS-Routing. Review application code to find code that uses WS-Routing.\n# **Determine whether SOAP message routing functionality is needed.** Most real-life applications that use Web Services can be implemented without using SOAP message routing. Review application requirements to determine whether SOAP message routing is necessary.\n# **Remove or replace code that uses WS-Routing.** If SOAP message routing is not necessary, then remove the code that uses it. If SOAP message routing is necessary, rewrite code that uses WS-Routing to use WS-Addressing instead.\n"
