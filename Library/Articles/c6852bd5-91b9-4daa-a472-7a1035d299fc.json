          "=Description=\nTLS should be used to protect any sensitive data in transit. Some applications don't use TLS even during authentication or when transmitting sensitive data, and an attacker may be able to intercept such data that is sent over the network unencrypted. \n\nThis vulnerability applies to all applications that send sensitive data over the network. \n\n=Impact=\nTransmitting data without using TLS allows attackers to intercept sensitive information using man-in-the-middle attacks. There are many different attack scenarios that are enabled by not using TLS. One common attack vector is exposed by the Firesheep tool. The Firesheep tool monitors open wireless networks for information about user sessions for some social networking web sites. Once that information has been sniffed from the network, the attacker is able to take over the user's session. Taking over the user's session allows the attacker to view the victim user's data and to impersonate him. This attack would not be possible if the target sites used TLS. \n\n=Countermeasures=\nTo prevent insecure transport vulnerabilities, use TLS for all sensitive communications, configure TLS to use strong cipher suites, and use valid certificates. \n\n* [[34c8d5b4-430d-4112-802b-f8c5fb786cfe|Use TLS]]\n* [[a6be174a-c52a-4513-8caa-2983fd6555a2|Use Only Strong TLS Algorithms]]\n* [[12098efa-6926-4603-968c-76c9416f6fa4|Use Valid TLS Certificates]]\n\n=Application Check=\nTo check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, verify that TLS is used for all sensitive communications, TLS is configured to use strong cipher suites, and valid certificates are used. \n\n* [[7eea0be2-6c3b-4d4c-a6f1-4e3fbb3f4295|TLS Is Used for All Sensitive Pages]]\n* [[84580cd7-3d37-40bf-b585-e029c8e6b5c3|Only Strong TLS Algorithms Are Used]]\n* [[8d2d20fc-a21a-4a1c-bb31-8a876e57abaf|Valid TLS Certificates Are Used]]\n\n=Computer Based Training Links=\n\nUse the following Computer Based Training courses for more background information about this type of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n==Creating Secure PHP Code==\n\nThis course introduces best practices for developing secure PHP code. The course also identifies common PHP vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain access to critical information. In addition, the course explains mitigation techniques that you can use to avoid common PHP vulnerabilities and write secure code. After completing this course, you will be able to describe the best practices for developing secure PHP code, explain common PHP vulnerabilities and learn mitigation techniques to avoid common PHP vulnerabilities and write secure code.\n\n[[https://teamprofessor.absorbtraining.com/ninja/#/courses/course/127620|COD 315P Creating Secure PHP Code]]\n\n//Valid login credentials and enrollment in the course itself are required to access Team Professor content.
