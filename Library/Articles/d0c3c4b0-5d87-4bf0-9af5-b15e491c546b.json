          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* Web Applications\r\n\r\n==What to Check For==\r\n\r\nVerify that logging is centralized.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nA centralized logging subsystem is simpler to maintain and implement correctly.\r\n\r\n==How to Check==\r\n\r\nUse the following steps to verify that logging is centralized:\r\n\r\n# **Identify the logging subsystem.** The logging subsystem should provide an API that allows generating log entries from application code. Make a list of functions that may be used to generate log entries.\r\n# **Examine log entries. Find out where log entries are stored and examine them. This should give you clues about the functionality of the logging subsystem.\r\n# **Review code.** Find code that generates log entries. Make sure this code uses the centralized logging subsystem.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nPerform the following actions to centralize logging: \r\n\r\n# **Identify existing logging functionality.** Examine the application architecture to identify logging facilities, such as the logging API and where audit trails are actually stored. Make a list of APIs used to log events, document how to use them, and where they store logs.\r\n# **Design the logging subsystem.** Design and implement a class or library specifically for logging. When designing the logging subsystem, consider sending logs to a remote log server. Consider the following factors when designing the logging subsystem:\r\n## Log throttling\r\n## Logging important event details for both successful and failed operations\r\n## Logging important security operations\r\n## Logging important business operations\r\n## Monitoring the use of privileged accounts\r\n## Logging user management events\r\n## Avoiding including sensitive information in logs\r\n## Logging unusual activity\r\n## Sending logs to a centralized server\r\n# **Implement the logging subsystem.** Write code that generates log entries according to your design. \r\n# **Use the logging subsystem.** Use the logging class or library whenever logs are generated. If earlier code exists that generates log entries, replace it with calls to the new logging subsystem API.\r\n"
