          "==Applies To==\n\n* Web Applications\n* Server-side\n\n==What to Do==\n\nWrite a dedicated logging library or class and use it whenever log entries have to be generated.\n\n==Why==\n\nA centralized logging subsystem is simpler to maintain and implement correctly.\n\n==When==\n\nUse this guideline when writing an application that generates log entries.\n\n==How==\n\nPerform the following actions to centralize logging: \n\n# **Identify existing logging functionality.** Examine the application architecture to identify logging facilities, such as the logging API and where audit trails are actually stored. Make a list of APIs used to log events, document how to use them, and where they store logs.\n# **Design the logging subsystem.** Design and implement a class or library specifically for logging. When designing the logging subsystem, consider sending logs to a remote log server. Consider the following factors when designing the logging subsystem:\n## Log throttling\n## Logging important event details for both successful and failed operations\n## Logging important security operations\n## Logging important business operations\n## Monitoring the use of privileged accounts\n## Logging user management events\n## Avoiding including sensitive information in logs\n## Logging unusual activity\n## Sending logs to a centralized server\n# **Implement the logging subsystem.** Write code that generates log entries according to your design. \n# **Use the logging subsystem.** Use the logging class or library whenever logs are generated. If earlier code exists that generates log entries, replace it with calls to the new logging subsystem API."
