Since there are many frameworks supported by Scala, we cannot examine them all in depth here. However, most frameworks should have authentication controls that are worth considering and may be sufficient for your application requirements. Even if authentication controls provided by the framework are used, it may be a good idea to write your own wrapper classes to centralize the authentication controls and to simplify using them.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Define authentication control APIs.</strong>&nbsp;Make the exposed APIs simple for developers to use.
