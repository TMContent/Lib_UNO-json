          "## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nUse strong session identifiers if your application keeps session state.\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nUsing cryptographically strong session identifiers prevents attackers from easily guessing session ids and taking over users' sessions. If an attacker hijacks the session he/she can perform the same functions as the logged in user. This will lead to a compromise of user account and in case the user is an administrator, the whole application.\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\nMost platform-provided session management implementations use sufficiently strong session IDs by default. Examine your platform's configuration settings to make sure the strength of the session IDs has not been degraded by inappropriate settings.\r\n"
