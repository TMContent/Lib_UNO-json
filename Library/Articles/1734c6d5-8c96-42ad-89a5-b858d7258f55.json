          "==What to Do==\n\nSelect a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and select well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis. For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification. When you use industry-approved techniques, you need to use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (CWE-325). These steps are often essential for preventing common attacks.\n\nDo not develop your own cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If your algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.\n\n==Why==\n\nAs commercially available computing power rapidly increases and new threats emerge, it becomes more and more important to use strong cryptographic algorithms to secure sensitive data. Strong cryptographic algorithms assure that an attacker cannot break encryption in a timely manner. Using the correct key size will also result in a more secure encryption. Different encryption algorithms require different key sizes for a similar level of security. According to the NIST guidelines, 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent to 256-bit AES keys.\n\n==When==\n\nUse this guideline whenever your application handles sensitive data.\n\n==How==\n\nPerform the following actions to encrypt sensitive data:\n\n# **Identify sensitive data.** Review your application design to determine what kinds of sensitive data your application handles.\n# **Choose cryptographic algorithms.** The recommended symmetric algorithm is AES. Strong asymmetric encryption algorithms are RSA, Elliptic Curve, and NTRU. When storing passwords use PBKDF2. The recommended key strengths are: 256-bit for AES, 2048-bit or more for RSA, 384-bit for Elliptic Curve cryptography, and 80-bit for NTRU.\n# **Choose libraries and APIs.** Find libraries that implement your chosen cryptographic algorithms. In some cases, they may be implemented by the platform. Find out the APIs for using these algorithms.\n# **Implement encryption.** Add functions to your applications that uses your chosen cryptographic APIs to encrypt and decrypt all the types of sensitive data that your application handles.\n# **Encrypt sensitive data.** Find code that handles sensitive data. Add code that calls your new cryptographic functions to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data as appropriate.\n\n\n==Computer Based Training==\n\nUse the following Computer Based Training course(s) for more information about cryptography:\n\n* [[https://teamprofessor.absorbtraining.com/ninja/#/courses/course/127643|DES 201 - Fundamentals of Cryptography]] - In this course, you will learn basic concepts of cryptography and common ways that it is applied, from the perspective of application development. You will learn the importance of randomness; the roles of encoding, encryption, and hashing; the concepts of symmetric and asymmetric encryption; the purpose of cryptographic keys; and the roles of message authentication codes (MACs) and digital signatures. In addition, you'll be introduced to key management, digital certificates, and the public key infrastructure (PKI). Most importantly, you'll understand that cryptography is extremely complex, and requires strong expertise to be properly implemented and validated.\n\n//Valid login credentials and enrollment in the course itself are required to access Team Professor content.
