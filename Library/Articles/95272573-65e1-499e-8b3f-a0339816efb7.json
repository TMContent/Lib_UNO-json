          "==Applies To==\n\n* Java\n\n==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that WS-Routing is not used.\n\n==Why==\n\nDon't use WS-Routing, because WS-Routing is vulnerable to routing detour attacks. The WS-Routing protocol doesn't have sufficient security features, so it should be avoided. \n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo check whether WS-Routing is used, ask developers whether the application actually uses WS-Routing, and review application code to find code that uses WS-Routing.  Search for keywords like \"WS-Routing\" and \"r:path\" to help find code that uses WS-Routing. \n\nIf WS-Routing is used, the code that uses it should be either removed or changed to use WS-Addressing instead.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo avoid using WS-Routing:\n\n# **Find code that uses WS-Routing.** Ask developers whether the application actually uses WS-Routing. Review application code to find code that uses WS-Routing.\n# **Determine whether SOAP message routing functionality is needed.** Most real-life applications that use Web Services can be implemented without using SOAP message routing. Review application requirements to determine whether SOAP message routing is necessary.\n# **Remove or replace code that uses WS-Routing.** If SOAP message routing is not necessary, then remove the code that uses it. If SOAP message routing is necessary, rewrite code that uses WS-Routing to use WS-Addressing instead.\n"
