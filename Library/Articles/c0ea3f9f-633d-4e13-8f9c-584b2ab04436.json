These roles should include administrative users and various types of users specific to your application.\n# **Implement authentication.** Implement and document authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements.\n# **Require authentication for all sensitive pages.** Add code to all sensitive pages that checks if the user is authenticated and authorized to view them.\n"
