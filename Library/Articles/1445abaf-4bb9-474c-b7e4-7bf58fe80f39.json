Search your code for calls to these functions in order to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.\n# **Validate all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use positive validation routines to check all data that gets included in HTTP response headers.\n# **URL-encode all data included in HTTP response headers.** Identify the functions that are provided by your platform to URL-encode data. Use these functions to URL-encode data that gets included in HTTP response headers.\n"
