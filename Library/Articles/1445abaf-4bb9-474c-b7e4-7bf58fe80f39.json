Search your code for calls to these functions in order to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.\n# **Validate all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use positive validation routines to check all data that gets included in HTTP response headers.\n# **URL-encode all data included in HTTP response headers.** Identify the functions that are provided by your platform to URL-encode data. Use these functions to URL-encode data that gets included in HTTP response headers.\n\n==Essential Server-side Security Guidelines==\n\n* [[e2c5d605-2b34-4e1c-80aa-211a0ad7b64f|Validate All Input]]\n* [[397488da-ce91-4768-9ad9-1e6928980d72|Use Prepared Statements for SQL Queries]]\n* [[496b6306-dca6-48b6-920e-67e768dbe334|Encode Input Included in Output]]\n* [[45d61f0a-c4d3-44f0-93b1-d8205cd13fbe|Force Reauthentication when Executing Critical Functionality]]\n* [[fdb460e6-5d18-4e35-a093-4b260155d79e|Include Unique Tokens in HTTP Requests]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000007ecacc|Use Role-based Authorization]]\n* [[1445abaf-4bb9-474c-b7e4-7bf58fe80f39|URL-Encode Data in HTTP Response Headers]]\n\n==Essential Server-side Security Checklist Items==\n\n* [[8dfa8088-a6cb-4062-8a44-0df8f2bc1cc4|All Input Is Validated]]\n* [[b5fb44c5-1702-42cf-b6be-894c511af7ac|Prepared Statements Are Used for SQL Queries]]\n* [[0ee9bc9f-c363-4a2d-be89-f84c069bda65|Input Included in Output Is Encoded]]\n* [[1c2b0859-c898-4f1c-b826-21392a7fc773|Reauthentication Is Enforced When Executing Critical Functionality]]\n* [[a2ef2a76-e562-4dd0-af9e-a6eb2b76c0d3|Unique Tokens Are Included in HTTP Requests]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008495ec|Role-based Authorization Is Used]]\n* [[3eb26600-9126-493a-a3cf-9d4b9815efc9|Data in HTTP Response Headers Is URL-Encoded]]\n"
