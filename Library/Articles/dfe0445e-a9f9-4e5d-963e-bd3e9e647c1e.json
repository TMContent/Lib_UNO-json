          "## Applies To ##\r\n\r\n- SAP ABAP\r\n\r\n\r\n## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nUse the ABAP central library function `ESCAPE`, or the Class implementation in `CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG`, to encode (escape) echoed untrusted data used by your program.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nWhen the built-in function (`ESCAPE`) or Class implementation (`CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG`) are used for encoding untrusted data, the application is protected from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Encoding or escaping data ensures that it is treated as literal text, and not executed as script.\r\n\r\nApplication vulnerability to XSS is on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 list for critical web application security flaws. XSS is a programming error which is highlighted by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) project. By including built-in mitigation techniques, your application is protected from XSS security threats. \r\n\r\n\r\n## When ##\r\n\r\nAlways use a provided method to prevent XSS. Never echo untrusted or user-modifiable data back to the user without appropriate encoding. The ABAP built-in `ESCAPE` function was made available as of SAP_BASIS 731. ABAP code for previous versions should use Class `CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG` to encode user input. Previous mitigation techniques used should be carefully reviewed and replaced with the most recent function available.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\nThese steps encode the data in echoed untrusted data:\r\n\r\n1. **Identify all sources of user input.** Determine all possible tainted inputs to the application. The following list includes some common input sources:\r\n\r\n\t- Form Fields\r\n\t- Query strings\r\n\t- Databases and data access methods\r\n\t- Cookie collection\r\n\t- Session and application variables\r\n\r\n2. **Identify all output that includes user input.** Trace all inputs to the system and determine which code will output it as a part of HTML, URL, JavaScript, CSS and XML contexts. Make a spreadsheet that contains all of this information.\r\n3. **Encode all untrusted data.** Use `ESCAPE` to encode data that gets included in HTTP response headers. Encode the data at the last possible moment before displaying it to reduce the possibility of double-encoding bugs. The following shows methods for various contexts:\r\n\r\n\t\t* HTML or XML\r\n\t\tout = escape(val = val format = cl_abap_format=>e_xss_ml)\r\n\r\n\t\t* JavaScript\r\n\t\tout = escape(val = val format = cl_abap_format=>e_xss_js)\r\n\r\n\t\t* URL\r\n\t\tout = escape(val = val format = cl_abap_format=>e_xss_url)\r\n\r\n\t\t* CSS\r\n\t\tout = escape(val = val format = cl_abap_format=>e_xss_css)\r\n\r\n4. **Encode all untrusted data (alternate method).** If the 'ESCAPE' method is unavailable use `ESCAPE_XSS_XML_HTML` to encode data at the last possible moment before displaying it to reduce the possibility of double-encoding bugs. The following shows methods for various contexts:\r\n\r\n\t\t* HTML or XML\r\n\t\tout = CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG=>ESCAPE_XSS_XML_HTML(val)\r\n\r\n\t\t* JavaScript\r\n\t\tout = CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG=>ESCAPE_XSS_JAVASCRIPT(val)\r\n\r\n\t\t* URL\r\n\t\tout = CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG=>ESCAPE_XSS_URL(val)\r\n\r\n\t\t* CSS\r\n\t\tout = CL_ABAP_DYN_PRG=>ESCAPE_XSS_CSS(val)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Guideline ##\r\n\r\n* [Encode Untrusted Data in Output](9b0ef1a5-c143-4e64-81cc-9e02ccbd9fbd)"
