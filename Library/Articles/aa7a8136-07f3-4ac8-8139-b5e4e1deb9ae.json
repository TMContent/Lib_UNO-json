          "==Applies To==\n\n* PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.1\n\n==Policy Statement==\n\nDo not store full track contents.\n\n==Policy Purpose==\n\nThe full card track contents should not be stored to limit the potential damage in the event of a successful attack. The term \"track contents\" refers to the information stored on the magnetic strip of the physical card issued to a cardholder. New cards also include a chip, the contents of which should also be considered \"track contents.\" If an attacker has this information, he may be able to use it to make fraudulent transactions; therefore, the full track contents should never be stored.\n\n==Related Guidance==\n\n* [[c05b8c53-3f76-4569-b212-177d5a208b00|Do Not Store Particularly Sensitive Cardholder Data]]\n\n==Related Checklist Items==\n\n* [[fd15d30d-8132-48fc-8962-870f096eff3b|Particularly Sensitive Cardholder Data Is Not Stored]]"
