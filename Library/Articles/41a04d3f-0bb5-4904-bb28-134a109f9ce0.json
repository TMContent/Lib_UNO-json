Common <span>restricted</span> resources include but are not limited to:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Resources that require authentication</li>\n        <li>Critical application resources</li>\n        <li>Sensitive/confidential data</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Ensure that restricted resources have the appropriate access controls.&nbsp;</strong>Determine if all <span>restricted</span> resources have the appropriate access controls assigned to them.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Check if there is separation on disk between public and restricted resources.&nbsp;</strong>Examine the local filesystem structure. Check if a restricted resource is located inside a public directory and vice versa.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Verify the local system permissions for all resources.&nbsp;</strong>For\n each resource, check that the local system permissions are set \naccordingly. If the resource is public, verify that anonymous users can \naccess it. If the resource is restricted, verify that only authorized \nusers can access it.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>To define the boundary between public and restricted content:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Determine roles.&nbsp;</strong>Define the various types of \nusers and their rights. Build a security policy for the restricted \ncontent and base the user groups' privileges around it.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Define the boundary.&nbsp;</strong>Structure the content according to access and logical orders. Try to use a modular approach when establishing the boundary.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Separate on disk.&nbsp;</strong>Once the boundaries have been\n established, reflect these boundaries onto the local file system. \nSeparate the restricted content from the public content on disk.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Set proper permissions.&nbsp;</strong>Set proper permissions \nto the restricted content. Dedicate a special directory for the \nrestricted content and require valid access before accessing content \nwithin this directory. These permissions can be enforced at the \napplication, server and operating system levels, depending on the \nenvironment in use.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p />"
