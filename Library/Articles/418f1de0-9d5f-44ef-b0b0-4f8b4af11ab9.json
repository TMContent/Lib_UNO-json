The vendor will usually make updates available on its web site.\n# **Check firmware versions on network hardware.** Compare the firmware version on each network device to the latest available version to make sure the latest firmware is installed on all devices. If policy allows it, it might be acceptable to use older firmware versions so long as they don't contain any known vulnerabilities that are fixed by newer versions.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo install firmware updates for all network appliances at least once a month:\n\n# **Identify all network appliances.** Create a spreadsheet of all network devices, such as routers, firewalls, and other network devices that have embedded firmware. \n# **Identify sources of network device updates.** For each network appliance, record where updates for its firmware may be downloaded from. The vendor will usually make updates available on its web site.\n# **Schedule regular updates.** In your information security policy, add a requirement that critical new patches be installed at least once a month. Specify a date or time period when updates should be installed. Install new security patches at least once a month. \n# **Document device configuration.** Document all the settings for each network device. Updating the firmware will frequently reset device configuration to the default settings, and the device needs to be reconfigured after that. Even for devices that allow you to back up the settings as files, it is a good idea to keep a copy of the configuration settings in the form of written instructions. Update these documented settings every time the settings are changed. It is best to make sure that the documented settings are accurate before installing firmware updates.\n# **Backup device configuration.** For each network device that allows saving its configuration as a file, make a backup of the device configuration. Update these backups every time the settings are changed. It is best to make sure that the backups are current before installing firmware updates.\n# **Install updates.** After making sure that each device's configuration settings are documented and backed up (if file backups are supported by the device), install the latest firmware update on each device that needs one. Perform this procedure at least once a month, but ideally within a couple of days of a new firmware update becoming available. Sometimes network hardware vendors are slow to respond to discovered vulnerabilities. If this happens, demand a firmware update from the vendor.\n# **Track update and version information.** In the network device spreadsheet, track information about the results of the updates, and track the current installed versions of all firmware.\n"
