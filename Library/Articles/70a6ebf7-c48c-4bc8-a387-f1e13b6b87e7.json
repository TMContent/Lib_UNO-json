Some examples are: file uploads, code execution, direct database access, and data deletion. Make a spreadsheet about all code that implements dangerous features.\r\n# **Make dangerous functions configurable.** Modify each piece of code that implements a dangerous function to check application settings to see whether the user has explicitly enabled the dangerous feature. Only allow a dangerous feature to be executed if the user has explicitly enabled it.\r\n# **Disable dangerous functions by default.** For each dangerous feature, write code so that the feature can only be executed if it has been explicitly enabled by the user.\r\n# **Document the dangerous functions.** Add information about all the dangerous features to the documentation. Explain why each feature is dangerous. Describe how to configure each feature.\r\n\r\n"
