          "==What to Do==\n\nProtect sensitive data in transit over untrusted networks using TLS with valid certificates.\n\n\n==Why==\n\nUsing TLS with valid certificates to protect sensitive data in transit prevents this data from being sniffed or tampered with. \n\n\n==What to Do==\n\nTo protect sensitive data in transit over untrusted networks using TLS:\n\n# **Purchase valid TLS certificates.** You may purchase a valid TLS key from VeriSign, Thawte, or your web hosting provider. Follow the vendor's instructions for purchasing the TLS certificate. The certificate is usually a .cer file. Make sure the certificate matches all domains used by the application.\n# **Identify code that sends data over untrusted networks.** It is more practical to secure all communications that to separate the communications that contain sensitive data from those that don't. Make a spreadsheet of all the code that uses networks to transmit data.\n# **Use TLS to protect data in transit.** If the code that sends data over the network doesn't already, modify it to only use TLS sockets with valid certificates for network communications."
