          "## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nStore uploaded files in a location that is not web accessible.\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nStoring uploaded files in a location that is not web accessible prevents shell upload vulnerabilities. Even if an attacker manages to upload a malicious script, they won't be able to execute it if the malicious script is stored in a location that is not accessible from the web.\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\nTo store uploaded files in a location that is not web accessible:\r\n\r\n1. **Find all code used to upload files.** Search your application for code that is used to upload files. Make a spreadsheet that lists this code. \r\n2. **Determine where to store uploaded files.** It's possible to store uploaded files in a folder outside of the web root or in a database.\r\n - Storing uploaded files outside the web root is a strong measure and easy to implement. However, it makes installing the application on a large amount of servers slightly more difficult, because the servers then need to be configured to allow storing files outside of the web root by creating a folder to store the uploaded files and granting the web server permissions to write to that folder. This additional configuration work is why many commercial applications store uploaded files in a web accessible location, and subsequently suffer from shell upload vulnerabilities. \r\n - Another mitigation method is to store uploaded files in a database. Files stored in a database cannot be accessed directly via HTTP requests, so even if an attacker is able to upload a shell, they won't be able to access it. If the application is already using a database, there is no additional end-user configuration required. However, this method is harder to code, and there is some maintenance overhead because the database and backups might become quite large. \r\n3. **Change code to store uploaded files outside web root.** Change each piece of code that is used to handle uploaded files so that the uploaded files are stored in the chosen location that is not accessible from the web.\r\n"
