The user enters his account number and PIN into the web page, receives an error message telling him to try again, and is redirected to the bank's real site. After entering his credentials again, the user successfully views his account. However, the phisher now has the user's online banking information.</p>\n  <h1>Solution Example</h1>\n  <p>The simplest solution is to get rid of the redirect altogether, but if it is necessary for application design, then mapping values may be used to mitigate this vulnerability. For example, if&nbsp;<i>redirect</i>&nbsp;page is used by the application to redirect to&nbsp;<i>balance</i>, a mapping value called \"<i>page1</i>\" may be created to signify&nbsp;<i>balance</i>. The page&nbsp;<i>redirect</i>&nbsp;should then be rewritten to accept mapping values as input, instead of URLs. The following URL should then redirect to&nbsp;<i>balance</i>:</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"http://www.onlinebank.com/redirectpage?map=page1\">http://www.onlinebank.com/redirectpage?map=page1</a>\n  </p>\n  <p>However, the following malicious hyperlinks will not work, because supplied input will not match any mapping value defined in the application:</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"http://www.onlinebank.com/redirectpage?url=www.phisher.com\">http://www.onlinebank.com/redirectpage?url=www.phisher.com</a>&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"http://www.onlinebank.com/redirectpage?map=www.phisher.com\">http://www.onlinebank.com/redirectpage?map=www.phisher.com</a></p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information about unvalidated redirects and forwards, please see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards\">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <div>\n    <br />\n  </div>"
