          "## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nRemove unused accounts.\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nRemove unused accounts because such accounts can be used by attackers to discreetly maintain access to the system. Removing unused accounts also helps mitigate the insider threat by making it harder by (former) employees to use these accounts for malicious purposes.\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\nTo remove unused accounts:\r\n\r\n1. **Identify all accounts.** Make a spreadsheet about all the user accounts used by the system and/or the application.\r\n\r\n2. **Review accounts.** Go through the spreadsheet and identify user accounts that are not being used.\r\n\r\n3. **Remove unused accounts.** Remove, or at least disable, accounts that are not being used.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
