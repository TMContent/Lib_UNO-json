          "Taxonomies help organize and classify vulnerabilities based on risk and availability to attackers. Many groups and organizations have compiled lists to help companies manage the vulnerabilities that are most likely to become a risk when creating software or services. These lists help programmers better focus their efforts on preventing  vulnerabilities from shipping in production code. View each taxonomy below to see which exploits are most frequently found, and compare the differences between each.\n\n  * [[c53dd5e7-6823-423f-b280-8b29fc089855|OWASP Top 10]] - The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 is one of the most widely referenced taxonomy lists, updated most recently in 2013.  Aimed at informing individuals and organizations about the most pressing web security risks, the OWASP Top 10 is frequently referenced when creating software and performing security reviews. View the OWASP Top 10 room to get a better understanding of the top security risks on the web.\n  * [[c1f4c3d6-c334-440f-a5f8-1b6b29924d6d|WASC Threat Classification]] - The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) Threat Classification aims to classify common security threats as either attacks or weaknesses. This effort is led by several industry veterans with the hopes of helping to secure the web from common application exploits. Enter the WASC Threat Classification room to better understand which vulnerabilities are considered attacks and which are considered weaknesses.\n\n[[e2f97ef0-6ced-4f3d-bdce-7a72e359eb7b|Back to the Vulnerabilities Area]]"
