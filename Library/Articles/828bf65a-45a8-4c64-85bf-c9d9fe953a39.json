          "## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nUse strong system passwords.\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nUse strong system passwords to make it difficult to compromise the system by guessing passwords.\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\nTo use strong system passwords:\r\n\r\n1. **Identify all system accounts protected by passwords.** Make a spreadsheet about all user accounts that are protected by passwords on the system that is being secured.\r\n2. **Define password complexity requirements.** Determine the password strength that is considered secure. For example: PCI DSS considers the following to be strong passwords: at least seven characters long, at least one upper case letter, at least one lower case letter, at least one number, at least one special character, cannot contain user id, expires at most every 90 days and cannot be the same as the previous passwords for that account. In practice, password length is usually more important than complexity.\r\n3. **Define password management requirements.** Determine how the passwords are going to be managed. Some kind of password management app is usually utilized for this purpose. It is common to practice ad-hoc password management, where each user is individually responsible for the authentication credentials and is free to use any password management approach. \r\n4. **Set strong system passwords.** Set the passwords for the accounts on the system to passwords that match the password strength requirements as needed."
