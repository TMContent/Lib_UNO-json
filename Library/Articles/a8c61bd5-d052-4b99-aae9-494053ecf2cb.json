          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* PHP\r\n\r\n==What to Do==\r\n\r\nDon't use WS-Routing. If you need this functionality, use WS-Addressing instead and protect Web Service connections using SSL/TLS.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nDon't use WS-Routing, because WS-Routing is vulnerable to routing detour attacks. The WS-Routing protocol doesn't have sufficient security features, so it should be avoided. \r\n\r\n==How==\r\n\r\nTo avoid using WS-Routing:\r\n\r\n# **Find code that uses WS-Routing.** Ask developers whether the application actually uses WS-Routing. Review application code to find code that uses WS-Routing.\r\n# **Determine whether SOAP message routing functionality is needed.** Most real-life applications that use Web Services can be implemented without using SOAP message routing. Review application requirements to determine whether SOAP message routing is necessary.\r\n# **Remove or replace code that uses WS-Routing.** If SOAP message routing is not necessary, then remove the code that uses it. If SOAP message routing is necessary, rewrite code that uses WS-Routing to use WS-Addressing instead.\r\n"
