          "<h1>What to Check For</h1>\n  <p>Verify that every password field is masked, i.e., the field displays identical characters for each character of the password. For example, when a user enters the password <font face=\"Courier New\">password</font>, the masked field may look like <font face=\"Courier New\"><em>********</em>.</font></p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>Masking password fields helps protect user passwords from someone that may be looking at the screen.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>To verify that every password field is masked:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Identify every password field in the application.</strong>&nbsp;Review all the pages in the application to find every password-type field. Password-type fields include secret answers, CVV, PIN, and other data which are equivalent to passwords.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Verify that every password field is masked.</strong>&nbsp;View each browser page that contains a password input field, and verify that each password input field is masked.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>To mask all password fields:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Identify every password field in the application.</strong>&nbsp;Review all the pages in the application to find every password-type field.

If you are implementing custom controls for password fields, implement these controls in such a way that they mask user input.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <br />"
