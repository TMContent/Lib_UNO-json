          "## Applies To ##\r\n\r\n- Ruby\r\n\r\n\r\n## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nChange the session ID for the user by resetting the session during authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nChanging the session ID during login authentication ensures that the session state corresponds to the authenticated user.\r\n\r\nAs part of the development of a secure application it is necessary to issue a new session ID to a user during the authentication process. If an attacker is permitted to use a session ID previously issued, they can assume the identity and privileges of the user during a session hijack. A properly-coded authentication process uses `reset_session`, so that unauthorized individuals cannot reuse a stale session ID.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\nTo change session IDs during login:\r\n\r\n1. **Identify authentication functionality.** Find the code that is responsible for authentication, including repeated authentication that is required for sensitive functionality.\r\n\r\n2. **Determine what session parameters to save.** Determine if session parameters should be retained. List the sessions parameters that need to persist for the user.\r\n\r\n3. **Change session IDs during authentication.** Add code that invalidates the current session ID and creates a new one. To reset the entire session, use `reset_session`.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
