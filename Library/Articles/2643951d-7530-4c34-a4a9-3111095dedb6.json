          "<h1>Applies To</h1>\r\n  <p>Scala and Play Framework 2.1.0+<br /></p>\r\n  <h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>Ensure that your application enforces strong passwords.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Enforcing strong passwords minimizes the risk of a&nbsp;Credentials Dictionary Attack&nbsp;or guessing another user's password.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>To ensure that your application enforces strong passwords:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Identify password management routines.&nbsp;</strong>Locate all routines inside your application that are responsible for managing user passwords. Potential areas to examine within your application include:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Modifying accounts</li>\r\n        <li>Creating new users</li>\r\n        <li>Changing passwords</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Review your application's password policy.&nbsp;</strong>Verify that your application provides a password policy. Ensure that the password policy addresses the following considerations that define a strong password:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Length</strong>: The policy provides length requirements for passwords. For example, require that a password must be at least 10 characters long.</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Input Set</strong>: The policy provides requirements regarding the input set of passwords. For instance, a password must contain letters, numbers and special characters. If your organization has special restrictions for passwords,&nbsp;verify that&nbsp;the policy adopts these requirements. For example, require that a password must not match the user's&nbsp;six previous passwords.</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Expiration</strong>: The policy provides requirements for a password's lifetime. For example, require that a password will expire after 45 days.&nbsp;</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Extra Requirements</strong>:&nbsp;Enumerate&nbsp;extra policy requirements for passwords, such as&nbsp;a password must not be trivial and easily guessed.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Verify that the password policy is enforced.&nbsp;</strong>Ensure that your application has implemented the password policy. Verify that all password management routines execute your application's implementation of the password policy before executing their own functionality. Example:</p>\r\n      <pre>def addUser(username:String,pass:String ) = Action{ implicit request =&gt;      \r\n      // Check if user exists in the user database\r\n      // The application verifies that the given\r\n      // password meets the password requirements\r\n      if (!goodPassword(pass))\r\n      {\r\n            String errMsg = \"User's password does not meet\"\r\n                           + \" the password requirements\";\r\n            Ok(html.message.main(errMsg))\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // Add user to the application's user database\r\n      ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n  def goodPassword(pass:String ) = Action{ implicit request =&gt;  \r\n{\r\n      boolean alpha = false;\r\n      boolean num = false;\r\n      boolean sp = false;\r\n\r\n      if (pass.length &lt; 10)\r\n      {\r\n            return false;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; pass.length; i++)\r\n      {\r\n            if (!alpha && Character.isLetter(pass[i]))\r\n            {\r\n                  alpha = true;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (!num && Character.isDigit(pass[i]))\r\n            {\r\n                  num = true;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (!sp && (pass[i] == '!' ||\r\n                  pass[i] == '@' || pass[i] == '#' ||\r\n                  pass[i] == '$' || pass[i] == '%' ||\r\n                  pass[i] == '^'))\r\n            {\r\n                  sp = true;\r\n            }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return (alpha & num) & sp;\r\n}</pre>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;PCI DSS requirements state that passwords should be at least seven characters long, have both letters and numbers and&nbsp;should expire after no more than 90 days.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p />\r\n  <p>What constitutes a strong password varies from organization to organization. However, there are minimum requirements for length and input character sets. Minimum requirements for a strong password are:</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>The password must be at least 10 characters long.</li>\r\n    <li>It must contain letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>The following steps are required for enforcing strong passwords:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Define password requirements.&nbsp;</strong>Pick the schema that all passwords must follow. Check them for length and certain patterns. All passwords should be long (e.g. 10+ characters in length) and include a large input set (e.g. alpha-numeric and special character values).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <strong>Enforce password requirements.&nbsp;</strong>The password requirements should be enforced while creating and modifying accounts.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Enforce password lifetime.&nbsp;</strong>Determine a lifetime of a password. Force the users to update their passwords on a given interval. Verify that the new password is different from the old password by comparing the produced hashes. Additionally users might be asked to not use previously used passwords.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p />"
