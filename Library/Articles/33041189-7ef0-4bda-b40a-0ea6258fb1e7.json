Restrict the access rights of your application's local account to prevent access to sensitive system data. It is recommended to:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Give full access only within the base directory.</li>\n            <li>Give read access only within the base directory's parents.</li>\n            <li>Do not give access anywhere else on the filesystem.<br /><br />It is also recommended to execute your application with its own local account rather than as the hosting server so that any restrictions applied to your application would not affect the performance of the hosting server.<p /></li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Avoid common mistakes.</strong>\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              <p>\n                <strong>Use the Java File object.</strong>&nbsp;As mentioned in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/ScalaStream\">Scala guidelines</a>, always use a&nbsp;<em>java.io.File</em>&nbsp;object to represent a file, rather than a&nbsp;<em>String&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>val</em>&nbsp;object. Using the&nbsp;<em>File</em>&nbsp;object allows you to access the actual file and some useful and relevant information such as the file's size, parent, path, etc. Example:</p>\n              <pre>File file = new File(\"d:\\myapp\\temp\\file.dat\");</pre>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>\n                <strong>Verify the canonical path.</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>File</em>&nbsp;object provides the file's path in&nbsp;three different forms -- original, absolute and canonical. Always use the canonical path when using whitelisting to verify the file's path.</p>\n              <p />For instance, the file<pre>d:\\myapp\\temp\\..\\temp\\..\\temp\\file.dat</pre><p>would have the following paths:</p><pre>d:\\myapp\\temp\\..\\temp\\..\\temp\\file.dat<br /> (Original via the <strong>File.getPath</strong> method)<br />d:\\myapp\\temp\\..\\temp\\..\\temp\\file.dat<br /> (Absolute via the <strong>File.getAbsolutePath</strong> method)<br />D:\\myapp\\temp\\file.dat<br /> (Canonical via the <strong>File.getCanonicalPath</strong> method)</pre></li>\n            <li>\n              <p>\n                <strong>Verify&nbsp;that the filesystem is case-sensitive.</strong>&nbsp;Always be sure&nbsp;that your application's filesystem is case-sensitive. Because most UNIX based operating systems have case-sensitive filesystems,<em>FILE.DAT</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>file.dat</em>&nbsp;represent&nbsp;two different files. However, Windows has a case-insensitive filesystem; therefore,&nbsp;<em>FILE.DAT</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>file.dat</em>&nbsp;represent the same file. If your application's filesystem is case-insensitive, make sure to specify the&nbsp;<em>CASE_INSENSITIVE</em>&nbsp;flag when using regular expressions to validate your file inputs. Example:</p>\n              <pre>val goodPattern = \"d:(\\\\\\\\|/)myapp(\\\\\\\\|/)temp(\\\\\\\\|/)(\\\\w|\\\\s|\\\\.|-|){1,20}\";\nval issafe = goodPattern.pattern.matcher(thepattern).matches</pre>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <p>\n                <strong>Verify the filesystem's path delimiters.</strong>&nbsp;Verify the path delimiters that your application's filesystem uses and keep them consistent throughout the code. For example, Windows uses '<strong><em>\\</em></strong>' or '/' to distinguish directories inside a path while UNIX based systems use only '/' to accomplish the same task.</p>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A tutorial on regular expressions is available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.regular-expressions.info/\">Regular-Expressions.info</a>.</li>\n    <li>For more information on using regular expression in Scala, see: Documentation for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.util.matching.Regex\">Regex Pattern</a>&nbsp;in Scala documentation.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <div>\n    <br />\n  </div>"
