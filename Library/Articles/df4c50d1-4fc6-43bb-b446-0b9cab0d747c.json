Use regular expressions to enforce strong password requirements.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Validate range.&nbsp;</strong>Restrict the acceptable range of numerical input by comparing the input to the maximum and minimum acceptable values.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>(Optional) Reject and respond to known bad input.</strong>&nbsp;This step does not add much actual security, but is included here as an additional option: The input validation subsystem may check for known attack strings. In response to an attack it may take actions such as:&nbsp; log detailed user information, alert the administrator, block the user's IP address for some time, and display an error message to the attacker informing him that you are onto him and reminding him of the consequences.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>(Optional) Encode input.</strong>&nbsp;If the input is going to be displayed back through the web application, consider encoding it to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <br />"
