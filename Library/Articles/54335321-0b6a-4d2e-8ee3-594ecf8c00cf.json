          "==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that object references that are passed as parameters to functions are checked for null before being used.\n\n==Why==\n\nCheck function parameters for null before using them to prevent your application from crashing if it tries to use that parameter as an object.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that object references that are passed as parameters to functions are checked for null before being used:\n\n# **Identify all functions that accept object references as parameters.** Make a spreadsheet of all functions that accept object references as parameters. Most functions in your application will probably be in that spreadsheet and that is okay.\n# **Verify that object references that are passed as parameters are validated.** Examine each function that accepts object references as parameters. Verify that each object reference is checked for null before being used as an object. If a function is passed null as a parameter instead of an object, the function should either throw an exception or simply not use that parameter as an object.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo check function parameters for null before using them:\n\n# **Identify all functions that accept object references as parameters.** Make a spreadsheet of all functions that accept object references as parameters. Most functions in your application will probably be in that spreadsheet and that is okay.\n# **Update all functions that accept object references as parameters to check parameters for null.** At the beginning of each function that accepts object references, add code to check each reference for null. If a function is passed null as a parameter instead of an object, the function should either throw an exception or simply not use that parameter as an object.\n"
