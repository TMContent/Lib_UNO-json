          "==Applies To==\n\n* Web Applications\n\n==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that authentication and authorization are required for all sensitive pages.\n\n==Why==\n\nAll pages that have private information should require authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized information disclosure. Use role-based authorization policies because they are relatively simple to manage correctly.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that authentication and authorization are required for all sensitive pages:\n\n# **Identify all sensitive pages.** Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive or private information.\n# **Verify that all sensitive pages require authentication.** Visit each sensitive page with a web browser to make sure it requires authentication.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo require authentication for all private resources:\n\n# **Identify all sensitive pages.** Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive or private information.\n# **Define roles.** Define access roles for your application. These roles should include administrative users and various types of users specific to your application.\n# **Implement authentication.** Implement and document authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements.\n# **Require authentication for all sensitive pages.** Add code to all sensitive pages that checks if the user is authenticated and authorized to view them.\n\n\n"
