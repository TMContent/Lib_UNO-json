          "## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nUse valid TLS certificates.\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nUsing valid TLS certificates helps prevent many types of man-in-the-middle attacks.\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\nTo use a valid TLS certificate:\r\n\r\n1. **Purchase a valid TLS certificate.** You may purchase a valid TLS key from a Certificate Authority. The certificate is usually a .cer file. Make sure the certificate matches all domains used by the application.\r\n2. **Be aware of certificate expiration.** TLS certificates expire and have to be renewed to remain valid. Make note of when the certificate is going to expire and plan to renew it before the expiration date.\r\n3. **Import the valid TLS certificate.** The exact instructions for importing TLS certificates are different for different platforms. Refer to your platform's documentation or technical support for detailed instructions on how to use TLS certificates.\r\n"
