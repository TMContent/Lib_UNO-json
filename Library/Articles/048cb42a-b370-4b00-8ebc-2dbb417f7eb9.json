          "## What to Do ##\r\n\r\nUse server-side authentication.\r\n\r\n## Why ##\r\n\r\nServer-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.\r\n\r\n## How ##\r\n\r\n1. **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication control as they pertain to your application:\r\n - Enforcing password strength requirements.\r\n - Allowing secure password reset or recovery.\r\n - Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.\r\n - Using multi-factor authentication.\r\n - Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.\r\n - Using TLS to secure communications.\r\n - Throttling repeated authentication attempts.\r\n - Locking inactive authentication accounts.\r\n2. **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls such as authentication on the server, because an attacker can tamper with client-side security controls or disable them altogether. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end.\r\n3. **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need:\r\n - An interface for managing authentication credentials.\r\n - Network code that communicates with the server using TLS.\r\n - A token or some other means to maintain session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.\r\n"
