However, if it is necessary, then at least validate the user data before using it to load code.\r\n\r\n3. **Validate the source of the code being loaded.** Use white-lists to determine the trusted sources of code before loading anything. Cryptographic signatures can also be used to identify trusted code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
