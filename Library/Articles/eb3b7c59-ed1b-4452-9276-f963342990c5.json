          "==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that events associated with the logging subsystem, such as the beginning and the end of logging, are logged.\n\n\n==Why==\n\nLog events such as the initialization of the logging subsystem to help detect when logs have been stopped to conceal malicious activity.\n\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo make sure that events associated with the logging subsystem are logged:\n\n# **Identify code used to start and stop logging.** Make a spreadsheet of code that initializes, pauses, or stops logging. This code should naturally be a part of the logging subsystem itself, so it should be easy to find.\n# **Verify that logging subsystem events are logged.** Examine each piece of code that starts or stops logging to make sure that it creates corresponding log entries.\n# **Examine logs.** Examine logs to make sure that initialization and stopping of the logging subsystem is logged.\n\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo log events associated with the logging subsystem:\n\n# **Identify code used to start and stop logging.** Make a spreadsheet of code that initializes, pauses, or stops logging. This code should naturally be a part of the logging subsystem itself, so it should be easy to find.\n# **Add code that generates log entries.** To each piece of code that starts or stops logging, add code that generates log entries indicating that the logging subsystem has been started or stopped.\n"
