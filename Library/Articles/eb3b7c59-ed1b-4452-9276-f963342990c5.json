This code should naturally be a part of the logging subsystem itself, so it should be easy to find.\r\n# **Verify that logging subsystem events are logged.** Examine each piece of code that starts or stops logging to make sure that it creates corresponding log entries.\r\n# **Examine logs.** Examine logs to make sure that initialization and stopping of the logging subsystem is logged.\r\n\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo log events associated with the logging subsystem:\r\n\r\n# **Identify code used to start and stop logging.** Make a spreadsheet of code that initializes, pauses, or stops logging. This code should naturally be a part of the logging subsystem itself, so it should be easy to find.\r\n# **Add code that generates log entries.** To each piece of code that starts or stops logging, add code that generates log entries indicating that the logging subsystem has been started or stopped.\r\n"
