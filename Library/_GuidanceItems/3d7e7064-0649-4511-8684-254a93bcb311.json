          "<h1>Applies to</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.2.a </li>\r\n    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.2.b</li>\r\n    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.3</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>What to Check For</h1>\r\n  <p>The network documentation should include an up-to-date network diagram that documents all connections to cardholder data, including any wireless networks.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>The network diagram is useful for maintenance and security tasks. The network diagram can help with identifying potential vulnerabilities in the network design, planning changes to the network and performing routine maintenance tasks. The network diagram\r\n is required to pass the PCI DSS compliance certification&nbsp;process.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Make sure there is a staff member maintaining network documentation. Make sure that the network documentation includes an up-to-date version of the network diagram, showing all connections to the cardholder data. Compare the network diagram to the physical network to make sure the diagram corresponds to reality. Make sure that a copy of the network diagram that shows the flow of cardholder data exists and that this diagram of the flow of cardholder data is also accurate.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Perform the following actions to draw a network diagram and to keep it up-to-date:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Choose diagramming software.</strong> To draw a network map, diagramming software is recommended. The choice of diagramming software may be left to the person responsible for the network diagram. One software capable of this task is MS Visio.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Diagram the&nbsp;servers and workstations.</strong> Identify all network nodes that handle cardholder data. Draw the network nodes that handle cardholder data on the network map. You might want to add notes that explain the roles of specific network nodes\r\n in handling cardholder data. These notes should be located next to the symbolic representations of the respective network nodes.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Diagram the&nbsp;routers and firewalls.</strong> Draw all the routers and firewalls that are connected to the network nodes that handle cardholder data. Draw the connections between the routers, the firewalls and the network nodes that handle cardholder\r\n data. Routers and firewalls are network nodes, but for the purposes of this article, we will use the term \"network nodes\" to refer to devices that have a purpose other than operations on the network layer.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Diagram the wireless networks. </strong>Draw all wireless networks that may be routable to the cardholder data environment.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Diagram the Internet connections.</strong> Identify all Internet connections. Draw all Internet connections on the network map. Draw the relationships of each Internet connection to the routers and firewalls.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Diagram the flow of cardholder data.</strong> Identify the flow of cardholder data. Make a copy of the network diagram and add notes to this copy that explain the flow of the cardholder data. Usually these notes should be located next to the links between the network devices.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Delegate responsibility.</strong> Designate a qualified person to prepare the network diagram and to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;up-to-date.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/19c8d409-b52c-44ac-b8d2-c668f32a5ec4\">Prepare the Network Documentation for PCI DSS Compliance</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/1859b12a-9369-46b2-848c-c9dc20fa1515\">Draw a Network Diagram</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/faa1bbb3-14c5-42ed-8350-534c1a8f3a4f\">Disable Unused Services and Protocols</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
