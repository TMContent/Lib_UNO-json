Each change should be tested for&nbsp;validation of all input,&nbsp;error handling, secure cryptographic storage,&nbsp;&nbsp;secure communications, and proper role-based access control.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Testing helps ensure that patches do not introduce new vulnerabilities or break functionality.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Review the change control documentation to make sure it contains descriptions of the testing results for each change, including patches. Review the change control documentation to make sure that each change is tested for&nbsp;validation of all input, error handling,&nbsp;secure\r\n cryptographic storage, secure communications, and&nbsp;proper role-based access control.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Create a testing environment that simulates the environment where patches are to be applied. Install patches in the testing environment. Test each patch for validation&nbsp;of all input,&nbsp;error handling, secure cryptographic storage, secure communications, and&nbsp;proper\r\n role-based access control. Document the results of the tests. If the tests are successful, apply the patches in the production environment.</p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <a href=\"/article/524359f0-e51a-4280-998b-cd2171d31918\">Implement Change Control Procedures</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
