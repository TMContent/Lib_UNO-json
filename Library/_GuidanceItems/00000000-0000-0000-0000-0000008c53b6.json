Consider the following when evaluating XML encoding: \n#* Data must first be converted to a uniform character encoding. \n#* XML entities must be escaped properly. \n#* Code that loads XML documents must be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.\n# **Verify that validation and encoding are used.** Make sure that all XML data is validated and encoded before it is inserted into XML documents.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo validate and encode data inserted into XML documents:\n\n# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.\n# **Identify code that handles XML documents.** Find all application code that handles XML documents.\n# **Write data validation methods.** Write methods that validate all the data types that are stored in XML documents and used by the application.\n# **Use validation methods.** Call the data validation methods from the previous step wherever the application handles XML documents. Validation should be performed before encoding.\n# **Write encoding methods.** Write methods that escape XML entities. Unfortunately, there are no stable libraries available for escaping XML entities for iOS. When writing code that escapes XML entities, consider the following: \n#* Data must first be converted to a uniform character encoding. \n#* XML entities must be escaped properly.\n#* Code that loads XML documents must be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.\n# **Use encoding methods.** Call the encoding methods from the previous step wherever the application handles XML documents. \n\n==Data Validation Guidelines==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000866d55|Canonicalize File Names and Paths]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000590dce|Check File Paths and Names for Null Bytes]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000051c329|Validate All Input]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005804d8|Validate and Encode Data Inserted into XML Documents]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000410a08|Validate and Encode Data Passed to UIWebView Controls]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000049bb5e|Validate File Formats]]\n\n==Data Validation Checklists==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004d996e|File Names and Paths Are Canonicalized]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004446d0|File Paths and Names Are Checked for Null Bytes]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000396c19|All Input Is Validated]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008c53b6|Data Inserted into XML Documents Is Validated and Encoded]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000647d44|Data Passed to UIWebView Controls Is Validated and Encoded]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000066105|File Formats Are Validated]]"
