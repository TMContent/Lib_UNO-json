Configure the centralized log server to keep the logs for at least a year and to keep at least the latest three months of logs available\n for immediate review. The exact instructions for configuring a log server vary by solution. Please refer to vendor's documentation or technical support for more information about configuring your log server to retain the logs for at least a year. Most log\n servers will be able to make a year's worth of logs available for immediate review, thus satisfying both aspects of the PCI DSS log retention requirement.\n</p>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/article/7a956911-f547-4f65-88bb-f4a42ea349f3\">Implement Audit Trails for System Components</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
