Check the firewall configuration to make sure that incoming and outgoing traffic is denied by default.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Identify network services necessary for business purposes. Implement a firewall configuration that reflects the ports and protocols used by the required network services. Add an explicit \"deny all\" statement to the firewall configuration or use an implicit\r\n \"deny after allow\" setting.</p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/b01167a3-95a9-4172-b366-d905ac2ac21e\">Configure the Firewalls for PCI DSS Compliance</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
