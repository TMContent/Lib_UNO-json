Document the business need for any insecure services to make sure they are absolutely indispensable.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Identify all services that are required for business operations. Identify which services are known to be insecure. Replace the insecure services with secure ones if possible. Add mitigation measures if possible and document them. If it is not possible to\n replace or remove insecure services, document the business need for them and the nature of known vulnerabilities.</p>"
