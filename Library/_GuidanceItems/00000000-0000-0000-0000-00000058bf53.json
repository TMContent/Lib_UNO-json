Some examples are:\n#* Passwords\n#* Encryption keys\n#* Personal information\n# **Review logging code.** Identify code that generates log entries by searching for //NSLog()// function calls. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo prevent logging of sensitive data:\n\n# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of all sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:\n#* Passwords\n#* Encryption keys\n#* Personal information\n# **Review logging code.** Identify code that generates log entries by searching for //NSLog()// function calls. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries. If necessary, rewrite this code in a way that does not log sensitive data. If //NSLog()// calls are necessary for debugging, they can be commented out in release mode using //#define// directives.\n\n==Privacy Guidelines==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001a0c7b|Do Not Cache Sensitive Data]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000930b93|Do Not Log Location Data]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000033f0db|Do Not Log Sensitive Data]]\n\n==Privacy Checklists==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008cb7d6|Sensitive Data Is Not Cached]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000007e16f2|Location Data Is Not Logged]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000058bf53|Sensitive Data Is Not Logged]]"
