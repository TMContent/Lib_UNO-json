The common security settings should reflect the features and capabilities of the target system. For example, if a device supports VPN, then the VPN settings should\r\n be included in the system configuration standards when relevant.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Identify each type of system on the network. For each type of system, identify security features and configuration options it provides.&amp;nbsp;Decide on the appropriate settings for the security features and capabilities of each system type.
