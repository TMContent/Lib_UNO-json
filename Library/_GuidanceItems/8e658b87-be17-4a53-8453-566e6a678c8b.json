Some options are:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>CIS: </strong>The CIS hardening guides are high quality and very explicit. The CIS hardening guides are called \"benchmarks\" and are available for most common system types and many applications. The CIS hardening guides make an excellent foundation\n for the company's system configuration standards. </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>NSA SNACs:</strong> The NSA SNACs are high quality and very thorough but are not available for the latest system types. The available NSA SNACs may be used almost verbatim as the system configuration standards if they match the system types used\n by the company. </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>DISA STIGs:</strong> DISA STIGs are similar to NSA SNACs and are government system configuration guides. They are high quality, have lots of pictures, and are available for recent systems. DISA STIGs pick up where NSA SNACs left off. There are relatively\n few DISA STIGs overall. DISA STIGs may be used as a foundation for the system configuration standards.\n</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>SANS:</strong> The SANS configuration guides vary in quality and are poorly organized, and not all common platforms are covered by the SANS configuration guides. For example, there appears to be no comprehensive SANS Windows XP hardening guide. Some\n of the SANS hardening guides are high quality and very thorough. It is worth checking if the system types that you are using on your network have hardening guides available from SANS. If so, they may be used almost verbatim as a company system configuration\n standards consistent with PCI DSS requirements. </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>NIST:</strong> The NIST configuration guides are generally presented in SCAP format, which is an XML based format used by network vulnerability scanners. As such, NIST configuration guides are not very useful for preparing formal system configuration\n standards unless a SCAP-capable scanner is readily available. Even then, turning SCAP guidelines into formal system configuration standards means using the scanner in a backwards way to convert the SCAP instructions into human-readable format. This is doable\n and the actual instructions are pretty good. The University of Texas translated the SCAP guidelines for several Operating Systems into human-legible format. Even so, the NIST guidelines are very basic, so additional research is required to flesh them out.\n The real way to use NIST SCAPs is as add-ons to a network vulnerability scanner.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Prepare hardening guides based on industry-accepted standards. </strong>\nCut out pieces from them that you don't need. It may be helpful to mention what the original hardening guides were to point them out during PCI DSS compliance assessment. Put all the remaining guidelines together to form your company's system configuration\n standards.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Apply the hardening guides.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Configure your systems to match the hardening guides. Use the configuration guides when setting up new systems.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For CIS hardening guides, please see \"The Center for Internet Security\" at <a href=\"http://cisecurity.org/en-us/?route=downloads.browse.category.benchmarks\">\nhttp://cisecurity.org/en-us/?route=downloads.browse.category.benchmarks</a>. </li>\n    <li>For NSA SNACs, please see \"Security Configuration Guides\" at <a href=\"http://www.nsa.gov/ia/guidance/security_configuration_guides/index.shtml\">\nhttp://www.nsa.gov/ia/guidance/security_configuration_guides/index.shtml</a></li>\n    <li>For DISA STIGs, please see \"Security Technical Implementation Guides\" at <a href=\"http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/stig/index.html\">\nhttp://iase.disa.mil/stigs/stig/index.html</a>. </li>\n    <li>For SANS White Papers, please see \"SANS: Information Security Reading Room\" at\n<a href=\"http://www.sans.org/reading_room/\">http://www.sans.org/reading_room/</a>.\n</li>\n    <li>For NIST configuration guides, please see \"National Checklist Program Repository\" at\n<a href=\"http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/ncp/repository\">http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/ncp/repository</a>.</li>\n  </ul>"
