Dynamic packet filtering is also known as stateful inspection.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Dynamic packet filtering makes sure that only packets that are parts of an actual transmission can pass through the firewall. Dynamic packet filtering prevents a potential attacker from sending custom packets to scan the network or performing network layer\r\n attacks.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Check the firewall configuration to make sure that dynamic packet filtering is enabled.&amp;nbsp;Use a port scanner, like nmap, to perform a syn-ack or a syn-rst port scan on the network devices in the DMZ from the Internet to make sure that such packets cannot get\r\n through the firewall.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Enable dynamic packet filtering on the Internet firewall. Refer to the firewall vendor's documentation or tech support for detailed instructions on enabling dynamic packet filtering on your firewall.</p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/b01167a3-95a9-4172-b366-d905ac2ac21e\">Configure the Firewalls for PCI DSS Compliance</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
