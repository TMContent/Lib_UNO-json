          "==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that TLS is configured to use strong cipher suites.\n\n==Why==\n\nChoose strong TLS suites to avoid known vulnerabilities in TLS. Weak crypto suites are subject to crypto attacks which will decipher and compromise confidential data. \n\n==How to Check==\n\nUse //SSLAudit//, //SSLScan//, //SSLDigger//, or //SSL Server Test// to check the TLS cipher suites supported by the server:\n\n# **Choose a TLS scanning tool.** //SSLAudit// is recommended for Windows and UN*X systems. //SSLScan// is an option for UN*X systems. //SSLDigger// is an option for Windows systems. //SSL Server Test// is a Web Application and is recommended for most applications, however it is limited to scanning only Internet-accessible servers.\n# **Use the TLS scanning tool.** Run the TLS scanning tool of your choice against your server to make sure that only strong cipher suites are chosen. The exact definition of strong cipher suites varies between different standards. Make sure that your server's configuration matches the applicable standards. The simplest way to make sure of this is to run the //IISCrypto// tool as described in the \"How to Fix\" section below.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nUse the free //IISCrypto// tool to choose strong TLS cipher suites:\n\n# **Download //IISCrypto//.** //IISCrypto// may be downloaded at https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto/Default.aspx\n# **Run //IISCrypto//.** //IISCrypto// is easy to deploy and has a very simple interface. Download and run //IISCrypto//.\n# **Chooose your desired compliance standard(s).** //IISCrypto// comes with presets based on common information security standards. It's simplest just to choose the ones that are the most applicable to your situation. In a couple of clicks, your IIS TLS cipher suites should be configured in compliance with the selected standards.\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* To download //SSLAudit//, see http://code.google.com/p/sslaudit/\n* To download //IISCrypto//, see https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto/Default.aspx\n* To download //SSLDigger//, see http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/ssldigger.aspx\n"
