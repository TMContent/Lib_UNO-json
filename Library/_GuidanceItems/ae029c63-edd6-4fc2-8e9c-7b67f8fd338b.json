Perform the vulnerability scans. If a scan is being performed as a result of network changes, it is acceptable to have qualified internal staff perform\n the scan. Required quarterly scans should be performed by a PCI DSS qualified ASV. It may be prudent to conduct a preliminary internal test with the available resources to eliminate the most obvious vulnerabilities, if any, before the ASV comes in.\n</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Fix detected vulnerabilities.</strong> If vulnerabilities are found, fix them and perform the scan again. Repeat scanning and fixing vulnerabilities until the scan returns acceptable results.\n</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Update documentation.</strong> Record the results. Attach them to the security documentation.\n</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
