Perform the vulnerability scans. If a scan is being performed as a result of network changes, it is acceptable to have qualified internal staff perform\r\n the scan. Required quarterly scans should be performed by a PCI DSS qualified ASV. It may be prudent to conduct a preliminary internal test with the available resources to eliminate the most obvious vulnerabilities, if any, before the ASV comes in.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Fix detected vulnerabilities.</strong> If vulnerabilities are found, fix them and perform the scan again. Repeat scanning and fixing vulnerabilities until the scan returns acceptable results.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Update documentation.</strong> Record the results. Attach them to the security documentation.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>"
