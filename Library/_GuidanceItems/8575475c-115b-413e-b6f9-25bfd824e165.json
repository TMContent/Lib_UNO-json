If possible, remove or disable all the network services that are not necessary for implementing the primary stated function. Some services\n may be a part of the Operating System or firmware and difficult or impractical to remove. If an unnecessary network service cannot be removed, disable it.If an unnecessary network service cannot be removed or disabled, document this network service and include\n an explanation of why it is running, i.e., “It cannot be removed in an expedient manner.” Consider implementing a mitigation measure to compensate for an unneeded, embedded network service, such as a firewall or a white list. The exact mitigation measure depends\n on the exact configuration and requires an expert opinion to be implemented correctly. Document the mitigation measures, if any.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Update documentation.</strong> Document the primary function of the server and the features and applications used to implement it.\n</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
