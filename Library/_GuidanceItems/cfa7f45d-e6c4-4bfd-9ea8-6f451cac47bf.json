The access controls in the testing and development environments are often not as strict as in the production environment, so using live PANs\n may lead to unauthorized disclosure. </p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Add a point to the information security policy to not use live PANs or other production data for testing or development. Instruct the responsible staff members to not use live PANs or other production data for testing or development.</p>"
