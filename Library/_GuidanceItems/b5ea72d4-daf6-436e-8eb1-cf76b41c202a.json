The term \"track contents\" refers to the information stored on the magnetic strip of the physical card issued to a cardholder. New cards also\r\n include a chip, the contents of which should also be considered \"track contents.\" If an attacker has this information, he may be able to use it to make fraudulent transactions; therefore, the full track contents should never be stored.\r\n</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Identify the storage mechanism that stores the full track contents, for example a script or a database query. Change the storage mechanism so that it does not record the full track contents.</p>"
