Identify which of these systems are deployed. Refer to the vendor's documentation or technical support\n of each deployed system&amp;nbsp;for information about the file-integrity monitoring capabilities of their product. If these solutions do not provide file-monitoring capability, verify the existence of a file-integrity monitoring system by checking the logs at the\n centralized log server and asking the responsible staff to demonstrate the administration interface of the file-integrity monitoring solution. Verify that the locations of each of the following files are being monitored: system executables, application executables,\n configuration&amp;nbsp;files,&amp;nbsp;log files (the centralized log server should monitor its log files).</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>For any system that does not include file-integrity monitoring functionality, deploy a product that does. Configure the file-integrity monitoring software to watch the locations of the following files: system executables, application executables, configuration&amp;nbsp;files,&amp;nbsp;log\n files (the centralized log server should monitor its log files).</p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>For information about TripWire, please see \"TripWire\" at <a href=\"http://www.tripwire.com/\">\nhttp://www.tripwire.com/</a>.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/article/47c3e227-0985-4a71-924b-2995fdb74aa3\">Deploy a File-integrity Monitoring Solution</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
