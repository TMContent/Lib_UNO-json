If frames are used in a web application, then the URL may not accurately reflect whether TLS is used.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Make a list of all parts of the web application that require cardholder data. Check each part to make sure HTTPS appears in the beginning of the URL when using those parts of the web application.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Use TLS to encrypt cardholder data sent to the web application. Install the TLS implementation that applies to the web server that you are using. Configure the web server so that TLS is used for accessing the web application. If TLS is not used for all parts\r\n of the web application, configure the server so that the parts of the web application that require cardholder data use TLS. If frames are used in the web application, place the page with the&amp;nbsp;frame-set&amp;nbsp;in a location that is accessible only&amp;nbsp;through TLS-encrypted\r\n HTTP.</p>"
