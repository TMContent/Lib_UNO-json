          "<h1>Applies to</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 5 </li>\r\n    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 5.1 </li>\r\n    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 5.1.1 </li>\r\n    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 5.2.d</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>What to Do</h1>\r\n  <p>Deploy and configure an anti-virus solution on all computer systems that are commonly affected by malware.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>A properly configured anti-virus solution may stop large scale automated attacks.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Perform the following actions to deploy an anti-virus in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Choose an effective anti-virus. </strong>An anti-virus package usually includes an engine and signature databases, and this functionality is largely determined by the anti-virus engine being recent, although both components have to be kept up-to-date\r\n to deal with the latest threats. The ability to prevent malware threats largely depends on an anti-virus component that stays loaded in memory.&nbsp;An anti-virus should be able to detect, remove, and protect against all known types of malware, including viruses,\r\n trojans, worms, spyware, adware, and rootkits.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Install&nbsp;the anti-virus.</strong> Identify the systems that are commonly affected by malware that have anti-virus solutions available. Such systems are typically Windows or Mac OSX based. Install the anti-virus by following vendor's instructions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Configure logging. </strong>Please consider getting an anti-virus that is compatible with the log server because this will make the proper log management procedures required by PCI DSS a lot simpler. Configure the anti-virus to send logs and alerts\r\n to the log server.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Configure automatic updates. </strong>Configure the anti-virus to perform automatic updates. An anti-virus should be able to update its engine and signatures automatically, which often requires purchasing a license to have access to these updates\r\n for a period of time, typically a year. Most anti-viruses have a control panel in the administration interface that includes an option to enable and configure the frequency of automatic updates. Some anti-virus packages have a control panel on the systems\r\n where they are deployed while some anti-virus suites offer a centralized control panel. The number of options offered by the anti-virus interface is usually small enough that a person with an IT background can figure out what all of them are and how to use\r\n them.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Configure automatic scanning. </strong>Configure the scheduler to perform automatic scans. An anti-virus should be able to perform regular automatic scans. Most anti-virus packages include a scheduler that allows configuring the frequency and type\r\n of automated scans. The types of scans usually include a \"full scan\" and a \"quick scan.\" A \"full scan\" typically scans all the attached storage media for known threats and usually takes too long to be practical. A \"quick scan\" scans the most common locations\r\n for malware to hide in&nbsp;and is sufficient for most applications, although an occasional \"full scan\" may be a good idea. The administration interface typically has an option to set the type and schedule automatic scans.\r\n</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>"
