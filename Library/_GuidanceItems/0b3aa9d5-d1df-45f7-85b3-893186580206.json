Examine a sample of database tables or files to verify that PAN is not stored in plain-text. Examine a sample of removable media that contains PAN information, if any, to confirm that the PAN is rendered unreadable.\n Examine a sample of the system logs to verify that the PAN is rendered unreadable or removed from the logs. Identify the mechanism used to secure the PAN. The acceptable mechanisms are: one-way crypto-hashes, truncation, index tokens and pads, and strong cryptography.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Identify if and where the PAN is stored. Choose one of the following mechanisms to protect the PAN: one-way crypto-hashes, truncation, index tokens and pads, and strong cryptography.
