          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.\r\n\r\n==What to Check For==\r\n\r\nVerify that a secure password reset function is implemented.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nPassword reset and recovery features are important to prevent locking out users that forgot their passwords. However, they also present a security challenge. An attacker might try to compromise user passwords by abusing the password recovery or reset functions. These functions by definition need to be accessible to unauthenticated users, so protecting them requires special diligence. \r\n\r\n==How to Check==\r\n\r\nTo verify that a secure password reset function has been implemented:\r\n\r\n# **Make sure that password resetting is implemented.** Review the application authentication mechanism to make sure that password resetting is implemented. Password reset is preferable to recovery - if an attacker manages to change the user's password, the user should be able to notice that a compromise has taken place.\r\n# **Check that password resetting is implemented on the server.** Examine the code that implements password resetting to make sure that security controls guarding it are implemented on the server.\r\n# **Check that user identity is verified during the reset.** Test the password reset functionality to make sure that the user's identity is verified sufficiently during the reset.\r\n# **Verify that a side channel is used to send password reset tokens.** Test the password reset functionality to make sure that the password reset tokens are sent using a side channel, such as the e-mail address associated with the username for which the password reset is requested. A side channel is a way to communicate information other than the one that is used to request the password reset. For example, if the password reset is requested via a web page, an e-mail message would be a side channel.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo implement a secure password reset function:\r\n\r\n# **Implement password resetting on the server.** Most of the password resetting functionality should be implemented on the server, since client-side controls are trivial to bypass. The iOS application might need a button on the login page for requesting a password reset.\r\n# **Verify user identity.** The best method for verifying user identity depends on the security requirements of the application and the types of information available about the user.  For example, the application could establish user identity by asking security questions that are associated with the account and proceeding with the reset only if the correct answer is provided. At the very least, the application should ask for the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.\r\n# **Use a side channel to send a password reset token.** The most common and effective solution is to send a difficult-to-predict token to the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.\r\n# **Provide a control for changing the password.** Once the user has the password reset token, the user should be able to submit that token and then change the password. This can be accomplished through a web page, a web service to the iOS application, or some combination of the two.\r\n# **Log the password reset event.** Both failed and successful password reset requests should be logged on the server. A large number of password reset requests may indicate an attack.\r\n\r\n==Authentication Guidelines==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003cccf2|Change Root Passwords on Jailbroken Devices]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000067c695|Encrypt Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006598ea|Implement a Secure Password Reset Function]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006171ed|Throttle Authentication Attempts]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005d4d08|Use Server-side Authentication]]\r\n\r\n==Authentication Checklists==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000076b90c|Root Passwords Have Been Changed on Jailbroken Devices]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004ce47f|Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network Are Encrypted]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006b19fc|A Secure Password Reset Function Is Implemented]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000816c4a|Authentication Attempts Are Throttled]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002a3f4d|Authentication Is Implemented on the Server-side]]\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For a guide on implementing a password reset function, please see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet"
