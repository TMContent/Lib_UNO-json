In the rare event it is required for a transaction, it should not be stored after the transaction has been processed.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Identify the storage mechanism that stores the PIN, for example a script or a database query. Change the storage mechanism so that it does not record the PIN.</p>"
