The term \"track contents\" refers to the information stored on the magnetic strip of the physical card issued to a cardholder. New cards also\n include a chip, the contents of which should be also considered \"track contents.\" If an attacker has this information, he may be able to use it to make fraudulent transactions; therefore, the full track contents should never be stored.\n</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>Check the following to make sure that the full track contents are not stored:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Incoming transactions </li>\n    <li>All logs (transaction, history, debugging, error) </li>\n    <li>History files </li>\n    <li>Trace files </li>\n    <li>Database schemas </li>\n    <li>Database contents </li>\n    <li>Any other place where cardholder data is stored</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Identify the storage mechanism that stores the full track contents, for example a script or a database query. Change the storage mechanism so that it does not record the full track contents.</p>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"/article/40de7c85-0fdd-4894-a3a1-943d4316fb12\">Prepare the Data Retention and Disposal Policies</a>\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
