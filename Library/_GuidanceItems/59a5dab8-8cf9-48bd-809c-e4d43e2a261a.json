A personal firewall offers some protection from network attacks and may prevent remote-control malware from working.</p>\r\n  <h1>When</h1>\r\n  <p>A personal firewall should be installed when the computer is being configured to remotely access the company network.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Perform the following actions to use the Windows Firewall to satisfy PCI DSS Requirement 1.4:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Launch the \"Group Policy Object Editor\".</strong>&amp;nbsp;Click \"Start\", \"Run\", type \"gpedit.msc\", hit \"OK\".

This may be\r\n unacceptable if the computer belongs to an employee, in which case, it is recommended that the computer not be allowed to access the company network remotely.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>"
