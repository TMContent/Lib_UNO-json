One way to implement this is by protecting the encryption keys with multiple passwords and distributing the passwords among multiple people. Another way is to give multiple people\n parts of the key so that together, they may assemble the whole key.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>Split knowledge access helps prevent insider attacks.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>To verify the use of split knowledge access to secure the encryption keys, perform the following steps:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Check the policy.</strong> Check the information security policy to make sure that it requires some form of split knowledge access to the encryption keys.\n</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Conduct interviews.</strong> Interview key custodians to make sure the policy is implemented.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Use the following steps to implement split knowledge access to secure the encryption keys:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Choose a split knowledge design.</strong> Decide on the way to implement split knowledge access to the encryption keys.
