The card verification code is often used for authentication in online transactions but does not need to be stored after the transaction\n has been processed.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>Check the following to make sure they don't include the card verification code:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Incoming transaction data </li>\n    <li>All logs (transaction, history, debugging, error) </li>\n    <li>History files, trace files </li>\n    <li>Database schemas </li>\n    <li>Database contents </li>\n    <li>Any other place where the cardholder data is stored</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Identify the storage mechanism used to store the card verification code, such as a program or a database query. Change the storage mechanism so that it does not record the card verification code.</p>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"/article/40de7c85-0fdd-4894-a3a1-943d4316fb12\">Prepare the Data Retention and Disposal Policies</a>\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
