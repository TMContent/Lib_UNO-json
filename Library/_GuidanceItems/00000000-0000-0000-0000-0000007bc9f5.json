          "==Applies To==\n\n* iOS applications that support file sharing.\n\n==What to Do==\n\nDisable file sharing whenever it is not being used.\n\n==Why==\n\nDisable file sharing to prevent unauthorized file access. Some applications share all the user's files by default. If file sharing is necessary, it should only be enabled when it is being used.\n\n==How==\n\nTo disable file sharing in applications that support it:\n\n# **Identify applications with file sharing capabilities.** Enumerate all the installed applications. Check each application to see if it supports file sharing.\n# **Disable or secure file sharing.** For each installed application, disable file sharing when it is not being used. If the application offers security features to protect file sharing, such as password protection, use these features to protect file sharing. Even if security features are available for file sharing, file sharing should be disabled when it is not being used.\n# **Disable file sharing by default.** When developing applications, disable file sharing by default in your applications.\n\n"
