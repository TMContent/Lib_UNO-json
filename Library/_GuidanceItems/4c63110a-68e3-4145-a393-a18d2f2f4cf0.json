Configure the centralized log server to keep the logs for at least a year and to keep at least the latest three months of logs available\n for immediate review. The exact instructions for configuring a log server vary by solution. Please refer to vendor's documentation or contact technical support for more information about configuring your log server to retain the logs for at least a year. Most\n log servers will be able to make a year's worth of logs available for immediate review, thus satisfying both aspects of the PCI DSS log retention requirement.\n</p>"
