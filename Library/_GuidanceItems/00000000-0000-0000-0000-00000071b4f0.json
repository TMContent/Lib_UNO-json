          "==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that data inserted into XML documents is validated and encoded.\n\n==Why==\n\nValidating and encoding data inserted into XML documents helps prevent XML injection vulnerabilities.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that data inserted into XML documents is validated and encoded:\n\n# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.\n# **Identify code that uses XML documents.** Review application code to find code that uses XML documents.\n# **Review validation code.** Make sure there are clear validation functions defined for each type of XML data handled by the application.\n# **Review encoding code.** Make sure there are encoding functions defined for XML data. Consider the following when evaluating XML encoding: data has to be converted to a uniform character encoding first, XML entities have to be escaped properly, and code that loads XML documents should be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.\n# **Verify that validation and encoding are used.** Make sure that all XML data is validated and encoded before being inserted into XML documents.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo validate and encode data inserted into XML documents:\n\n# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.\n# **Identify code that uses XML documents.** Review application code to find code that uses XML documents.\n# **Add data validation code.** Add methods that validate all the data types that are stored in XML documents and used by the application.\n# **Use validation code.** Add code that uses the data validation methods from the previous step to code that uses XML documents. Validation should be performed before encoding.\n# **Add encoding code.** Add methods that escape XML entities. Unfortunately, there are no stable libraries available for escaping XML entities for iOS. When writing code that escapes XML entities, consider the following: data has to be converted to a uniform character encoding first, XML entities have to be escaped properly, and code that loads XML documents should be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.\n# **Use encoding code.** Add code that encodes data to code that uses XML documents. \n\n==Data Validation Guidelines==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008d3cec|Canonicalize File Names and Paths]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008149ca|Validate All Input]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006c7089|Validate and Encode Data Inserted into XML Documents]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000007635ae|Validate File Formats]]\n\n==Data Validation Checklists==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000009763b8|File Names and Paths Are Canonicalized]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004f2fec|All Input Is Validated]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000071b4f0|Data Inserted into XML Documents Is Validated and Encoded]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000080c790|File Formats Are Validated]]"
