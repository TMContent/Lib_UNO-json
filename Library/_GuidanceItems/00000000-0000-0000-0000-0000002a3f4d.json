Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. \r\n# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need:\r\n#* An interface for managing authentication credentials.\r\n#* Network code that communicates with the server using TLS. \r\n#* A token or some other means to maintain a session state on the server.  \r\n#* Possibly, secure storage for cached authentication credentials.\r\n\r\n==Authentication Guidelines==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003cccf2|Change Root Passwords on Jailbroken Devices]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000067c695|Encrypt Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006598ea|Implement a Secure Password Reset Function]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006171ed|Throttle Authentication Attempts]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005d4d08|Use Server-side Authentication]]\r\n\r\n==Authentication Checklists==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000076b90c|Root Passwords Have Been Changed on Jailbroken Devices]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004ce47f|Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network Are Encrypted]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006b19fc|A Secure Password Reset Function Is Implemented]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000816c4a|Authentication Attempts Are Throttled]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002a3f4d|Authentication Is Implemented on the Server-side]]\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For more information about authentication requirements, please see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet"
