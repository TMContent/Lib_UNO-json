          "<h1>Applies to</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 6.2 </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>What to Check For</h1>\n  <p>Processes should be in place to keep the staff informed of the latest discovered security vulnerabilities. Such processes may involve signing up for a mailing list and visiting web-sites focused on security.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>The information security community is very active on-line and provides many valuable resources for tracking the latest discovered vulnerabilities. Potential attackers monitor these resources, so it is important to mitigate these new threats before they are\n exploited.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>Interview the responsible personnel and ask them what resources they use to keep track of the newly discovered security vulnerabilities.\n</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Add a requirement to the information security policy for the responsible staff members to use outside resources to stay informed about the latest discovered security vulnerabilities. Instruct the staff to review on-line security vulnerability tracking resources\n periodically. Instruct at least one staff member to sign up for the BugTraq mailing list and other similar mailing lists as appropriate.</p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>To sign up for the BugTraq mailing list, please visit \"Security Focus\" at <a href=\"http://www.securityfocus.com/\">\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com</a></li>\n    <li>For a list of recently discovered vulnerabilities, please see \"Security Focus Vulnerabilities\" at\n<a href=\"http://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities\">http://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities</a></li>\n    <li>To check the latest public exploits, please see \"PacketStorm\" at <a href=\"http://www.packetstormsecurity.org/exploits100.html\">\nhttp://www.packetstormsecurity.org/exploits100.html</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/article/b528492e-41ed-4645-97c6-8b78fb3f53ed\">Keep Track of New Security Vulnerabilities</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
