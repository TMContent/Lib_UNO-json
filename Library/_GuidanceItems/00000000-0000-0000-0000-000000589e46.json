          "==Applies To==\n\n* Android applications that authenticate to a remote server.\n\n==What to Do==\n\nEncrypt authentication credentials sent over the network. Using TLS is the simplest way to protect the authentication process.\n\n==Why==\n\nEncrypting authentication credentials sent over the network helps prevent various man-in-the-middle attacks, such as spoofing or hijacking.\n\n==How==\n\nTo encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network:\n\n# **Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.** Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication. However, there are other options available, such as certificates. \n# **Identify the authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both end points need to support TLS. \n# **Encrypt authentication credentials in transit.** Add code that uses TLS to protect authentication credentials in transit. \n\n==Authentication Guidelines==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000589e46|Encrypt Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002eb5bd|Implement a Secure Password Reset Function]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002a1fe0|Throttle Authentication Attempts]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000081c795|Use Server-side Authentication]]\n\n==Authentication Checklists==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000582050|Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network Are Encrypted]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000035726e|A Secure Password Reset Function Is Implemented]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000016d320|Authentication Attempts Are Throttled]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000029e0c4|Authentication Is Implemented on the Server-side]]\n\n==Additional Resources==\n* For information about the Android TLS API, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html\n* For information about the //SSLEngine// class, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLEngine.html\n* For information about the //SSLSocketFactory// class, see http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.html\n* For information about the //javax.net.ssl// package, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html\n* For information about TLS configuration in general, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet."
