Use explicit \"deny all\" or implicit \"deny after allow\" settings to block unauthorized traffic by default.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>Allowing unauthorized connections may allow an attacker to conduct an attack and extract sensitive information.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Configure the firewall using either the \"deny all\" setting or the \"deny after allow‚Äù setting. When using the \"deny all\" rule, set it after the rules that allow services necessary for business operations. If your firewall supports implicit \"deny after allow\"\n functionality, you may use it instead.</p>"
