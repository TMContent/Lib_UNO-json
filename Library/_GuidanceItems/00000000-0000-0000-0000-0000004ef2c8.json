          "==What to Do==\n\nSign updates to the application.\n\n==Why==\n\nSign updates to the application to help verify that the updates came from a trusted party.\n\n==How==\n\nSigning updates is an important principle in software development; it prevents malicious software from masquerading as updates to legitimate software. In practice, updates to mobile software are usually distributed as complete new versions, rather than as patches to the already installed software. The updated software package is usually signed, because otherwise it won't be allowed on the most popular distribution channels. Therefore, the process for signing mobile software and updates is usually already established by software developers. It is still important to be aware of the importance of signing software and software updates.\n\n==Code Integrity Guidelines==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004ef2c8|Sign Android Application Updates]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003c4a74|Sign Android Applications]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000038da94|Obfuscate Code with ProGuard]]\n\n==Code Integrity Checklists==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000007571e5|Android Application Updates Are Signed]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000045de75|Android Applications Are Signed]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008e33ab|Code Is Obfuscated with ProGuard]]\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* For more information about signing Android applications, please see http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html"
