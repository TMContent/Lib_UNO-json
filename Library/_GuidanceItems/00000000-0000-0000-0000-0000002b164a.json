          "==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that TLS is used to protect communications.\n\n==Why==\n\nUsing TLS to secure network communications prevents eavesdropping attacks.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that TLS is used to protect network connections:\n\n# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.\n# **Review communication security requirements.** Examine which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.\n# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.\n# **Verify that TLS is used to protect network connections.** Examine code that is responsible for network connections that need to be encrypted and make sure that it uses TLS.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo use TLS to protect network connections:\n\n# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.\n# **Define communication security requirements.** Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.\n# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.\n# **Add code that uses TLS.** There are multiple methods for using TLS in Android to choose from based on application requirements. Using the //SSLSocketFactory// class is one of the most common solutions.\n\n==Communication Security Guidelines==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000657ab9|Disable Self-signed TLS Certificates]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000a1df2|Use TLS to Protect Communications]]\n\n==Communication Security Checklists==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001fdc3e|Self-signed TLS Certificates Are Disabled]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002b164a|TLS Is Used to Protect Communications]]\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* For information about the Android TLS API, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html\n* For information about the //SSLEngine// class, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLEngine.html\n* For information about the //SSLSocketFactory// class, see http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.html\n* For information about the //javax.net.ssl// package, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html\n"
