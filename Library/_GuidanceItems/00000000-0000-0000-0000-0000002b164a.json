All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.\r\n# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.\r\n# **Verify that SSL is used to protect network connections.** Examine code that is responsible for network connections that need to be encrypted and make sure that it uses SSL.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo use SSL to protect network connections:\r\n\r\n# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.\r\n# **Define communication security requirements.** Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.\r\n# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.\r\n# **Add code that uses SSL.** There are multiple methods for using SSL in Android to choose from based on application requirements. Using the //SSLSocketFactory// class is one of the most common solutions.\r\n\r\n==Communication Security Guidelines==\r\n\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000657ab9|Disable Self-signed SSL Certificates]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000a1df2|Use SSL to Protect Communications]]\r\n\r\n==Communication Security Checklists==\r\n\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001fdc3e|Self-signed SSL Certificates Are Disabled]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002b164a|SSL Is Used to Protect Communications]]\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For information about the Android SSL API, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html\r\n* For information about the //SSLEngine// class, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLEngine.html\r\n* For information about the //SSLSocketFactory// class, see http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.html\r\n* For information about the //javax.net.ssl// package, see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html\r\n"
