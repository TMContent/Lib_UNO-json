          "==Applies To==\n\n* Android applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.\n\n==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that self-signed TLS certificates are disabled.\n\n==Why==\n\nAllowing the use of self-signed TLS certificates enables some types of man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nSelf-signed TLS certificates are disabled on Android by default. To verify that self-signed TLS certificates are disabled:\n\n# **Search for code that allows self-signed TLS certificates.** Search application code for the presence of the //setDefaultHostnameVerifier// method call - the presence of this method call indicates that self-signed TLS certificates may be allowed.\n# **Verify that self-signed TLS certificates are not allowed in production releases.** If self-signed TLS certificates are allowed for development purposes, make sure that they are disabled in production releases. The recommended way to disable development code in production releases is by using //#define// and //#ifdef// compiler directives.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nSelf-signed TLS certificates are disabled on Android by default. Do not allow them in production releases.\n\n==Communication Security Guidelines==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000657ab9|Disable Self-signed TLS Certificates]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000a1df2|Use TLS to Protect Communications]]\n\n==Communication Security Checklists==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001fdc3e|Self-signed TLS Certificates Are Disabled]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002b164a|TLS Is Used to Protect Communications]]\n\n"
