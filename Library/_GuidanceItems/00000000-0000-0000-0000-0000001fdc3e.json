To verify that self-signed TLS certificates are disabled:\r\n\r\n# **Search for code that allows self-signed TLS certificates.** Search application code for the presence of the //setDefaultHostnameVerifier// method call - the presence of this method call indicates that self-signed TLS certificates may be allowed.\r\n# **Verify that self-signed TLS certificates are not allowed in production releases.** If self-signed TLS certificates are allowed for development purposes, make sure that they are disabled in production releases. The recommended way to disable development code in production releases is by using //#define// and //#ifdef// compiler directives.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nSelf-signed TLS certificates are disabled on Android by default. Do not allow them in production releases.\r\n\r\n==Communication Security Guidelines==\r\n\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000657ab9|Disable Self-signed TLS Certificates]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000a1df2|Use TLS to Protect Communications]]\r\n\r\n==Communication Security Checklists==\r\n\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001fdc3e|Self-signed TLS Certificates Are Disabled]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002b164a|TLS Is Used to Protect Communications]]\r\n\r\n"
