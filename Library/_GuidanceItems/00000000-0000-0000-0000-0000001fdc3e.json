To verify that self-signed SSL certificates are disabled:\r\n\r\n# **Search for code that allows self-signed SSL certificates.** Search application code for the presence of the //setDefaultHostnameVerifier// method call - the presence of this method call indicates that self-signed SSL certificates may be allowed.\r\n# **Verify that self-signed SSL certificates are not allowed in production releases.** If self-signed SSL certificates are allowed for development purposes, make sure that they are disabled in production releases. The recommended way to disable development code in production releases is by using //#define// and //#ifdef// compiler directives.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nSelf-signed SSL certificates are disabled on Android by default.
