          "==What to Check For==\n\nMake sure that //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags are set on session cookies.\n\n==Why==\n\nThe //Secure// flag should be set on session cookie to protect its contents from eavesdropping attacks.  These attacks, if successful, can be used to hijack the userâ€™s session and interact with the application as if they were the real user. Setting the //Secure// flag on session cookie ensures it is only transferred over connections that are secured by TLS and prevents eavesdropping.\n\nThe //HTTPOnly// flag should be set on session cookie to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Setting the //HTTPOnly// flag on session cookie prevents the contents of the cookie from being transmitted by a client-side script. Since in a Cross-Site Scripting attack  an arbitrary script runs in the context of the user's browser, the //HTTPOnly// flag effectively prevents the malicious script from using the cookie in the attack.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo check if //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags are set on session cookies:\n\n# **Load the application and authenticate.** Open the application with a web browser and authenticate. It's okay to start the session in some other way and many applications will create sessions even for users that aren't authenticated. Logging in is a certain way to start a session for any reasonably designed application that uses sessions. Make sure that the application uses TLS - most browsers indicate that with an icon in the URL bar.\n# **Examine the session cookies.** Use a web browser option or plugin that shows detailed information about the current cookies. Examine the session cookie created by the application. Make sure that it has the //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags set.\n# **Examine Web.config.** Review the Web.config configuration file on the server side to make sure that //httpOnlyCookies// and //requireSSL// properties are set to //true// for the //httpCookies// element. These settings will actually set //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags for all cookies. This is not strictly required to pass this checklist, but these settings are recommended.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo set //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags on session cookies:\n\n# **Configure IIS to use TLS.** Get a valid certificate. Hosting service providers often sell valid TLS certificates. Install the certificate. Create an HTTPS binding for the site. A link in the \"Additional Resources\" section describes how to do this in detail.\n# **Set the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags for session cookies.** Edit the Web.config file. Set the //httpOnlyCookies// property to //true// for the //httpCookies// element. Set the //requireSSL// property to //true// for the //httpCookies// element. There are different ways to write this in XML. Here is one: <httpcookies httponlycookies=\"true\" requiressl=\"true\"></httpcookies>\n\n"
