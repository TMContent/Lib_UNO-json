This should be observed over the external and local networks.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Use a strong encryption tunnel to secure administrative access. The exact type of tunnel depends on the application. Some common tunnels are VPN, SSH, and SSL. Most modern systems include an option or functionality to encrypt remote administrative access.\n For detailed instructions on encrypting administrative access on your systems, please refer to the vendor's documentation or technical support.</p>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/article/4f3287a7-aafd-4d85-8387-ec24e2bdd656\">Encrypt Remote Administrator Access</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
