          "==Applies To==\r\n* Java\r\n\r\n==What to Check For==\r\n\r\nVerify that data sent to the user in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nIf the application accepts user input and includes such input in HTTP response headers the application will be vulnerable to response splitting vulnerability unless headers are URL-encoded or data is sanitized. Attackers can execute a cross site scripting attack by forcing your application to send carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) followed by malicious content to the users browser. Because CRLF is a response header separator and CRLF CRLF separates headers from the body,  the browser sees attackers content as legitimate. \r\n\r\n==How to Check==\r\n\r\nTo verify that data in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded:\r\n\r\n# **Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.** Search your code for calls to //HttpServletResponse.AddHeader// and for //HttpServletResponse.AddCookie// to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.\r\n# **Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is validated.** Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is passed through positive validation routines before being included in HTTP response headers.\r\n# **Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded.** Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is URL-encoded using //java.net.URLEncoder// class before being included in HTTP response headers.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\nTo URL-encode data in HTTP Response headers:\r\n# **Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.** Search your code for calls to // HttpServletResponse.AddHeader// and for //HttpServletResponse.AddCookie// to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.\r\n# **Validate all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use positive validation routines to check all data that gets included in HTTP response headers.\r\n# **URL-encode all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use //java.net.URLEncoder// class to URL-encode data that gets includes in HTTP response headers.\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For more information about the //URLEncoder.encode// method, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/URLEncoder.html"
