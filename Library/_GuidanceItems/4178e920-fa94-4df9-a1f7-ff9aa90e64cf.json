A DMZ is a network segment that contains machines that may handle incoming Internet traffic. There may be more than one DMZ.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>The DMZ is a defense-in-depth measure used to separate systems that are open to attacks from those that hold sensitive information. When a DMZ is implemented, even if the systems in the DMZ are compromised, the attacker does not have full access to the sensitive\r\n information.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Designate a network segment as the DMZ. Install and configure a firewall between the DMZ and the Internet. Install and configure a firewall between the DMZ and the internal network segment. Document the network. For more information about setting up a DMZ,\r\n please refer to the article, â€œConfigure the Routers for PCI DSS Compliance\".</p>"
