Detecting such devices clearly indicate the presence of an attack.\r\n</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Interview the responsible personnel to identify the location of the IDS/IPS and ask them to demonstrate the administration interface. Verify that the IDS/IPS is set up to notify staff if an unauthorized wireless device is detected.\r\n</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Choose a wireless IDS or IPS solution. Configure the wireless IDS or IPS by following the vendor's instructions. Set the IDS or IPS to alert the staff in the event of a suspected compromise.\r\n</p>\r\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For a list of many wireless security tools, please see \"Wireless Security Tools\" at\r\n<a href=\"http://www.corecom.com/html/wlan_tools.html\">http://www.corecom.com/html/wlan_tools.html\r\n</a></li>\r\n    <li>For information about Motorola Defense Solutions, please see \"Wireless Security &amp; Compliance, Infrastructure Management and Network Assurance\" at\r\n<a href=\"http://www.airdefense.net/products/enterprise.php\">http://www.airdefense.net/products/enterprise.php\r\n</a></li>\r\n    <li>For information about Aruba Networks Wireless IDS, please see \"Wireless Intrusion Detection &amp; Prevention\" at\r\n<a href=\"http://www.arubanetworks.com/solutions/use_cases/intrusion_detection.php\">\r\nhttp://www.arubanetworks.com/solutions/use_cases/intrusion_detection.php</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/3c7e9cde-98e5-45b6-800e-d150d99fea16\">Deploy a Wireless IDS</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
