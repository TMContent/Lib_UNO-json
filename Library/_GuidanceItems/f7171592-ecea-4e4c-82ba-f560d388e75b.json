If PANs are used, they should be sanitized before use.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>There may be vulnerabilities in the testing and development environments that may cause unauthorized disclosure. The access controls in the testing and development environments are often not as strict as in the production environment, so using live PANs\n may lead to unauthorized disclosure. </p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>Interview the responsible staff members to make sure they don't use live PANs or other production data for testing or development.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Add a point to the information security policy to not use live PANs or other production data for testing or development. Instruct the responsible staff members to not use live PANs or other production data for testing or development.</p>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"/article/d530bf4b-7b06-4c1b-858a-72293e237081\">Organize the Software Development Processes for PCI DSS Compliance</a>\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
