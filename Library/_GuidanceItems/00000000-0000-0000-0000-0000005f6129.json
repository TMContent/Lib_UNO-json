          "==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled.\n\n==Why==\n\nParsing external entities in XML documents may result in injection vulnerabilities.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled:\n\n# **Identify the XML parser used by the application.** Find out which XML parser is used by the application. Some common Android XML parsers are: //SAXParser//, //XmlPullParser// and //DocumentBuilder//.\n# **Verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled.** //DocumentBuilder// and //XmlPullParser// don't support external XML entities. If //SAXParser// is used, make sure that //external-general-entities// and //external-parameter-entities// feature flags have not been enabled.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nThere are multiple parsing packages built into the Android SDK: //SAXParser//, //XmlPullParser// and //DocumentBuilder//.\n\n//DocumentBuilder// doesn't support external XML entities.\n\n//XmlPullParser// doesn't support external XML entities.\n\n//SAXParser// has parsing of external XML entities disabled by default. Parsing of external XML entities is configured in //SAXParser// using //external-general-entities// and //external-parameter-entities// feature flags. Please, make sure that these flags are not enabled by the application.\n\n==Related Items==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002e2664|Disable Parsing of External XML Entities]]\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* For more information about Android XML parsers, please see http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/xml/parsers/package-summary.html\n* For a full list of feature flags supported by the SAX XML parser, please see: http://sax.sourceforge.net/apidoc/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html#package_description\n* For more information about the //SAX2// parser, please see http://developer.android.com/reference/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html\n* For more information about the //XmlPullParser// class, please see http://developer.android.com/reference/org/xmlpull/v1/XmlPullParser.html"
