          "==Applies To==\n* HTML5\n\n==What to Check For==\n\nEnsure that TCP connections are not tunneled via WebSockets. Instead, those connections are made through standard TCP ports. \n\n==Why==\n\nDo not use WebSockets to tunnel TCP connections for several reasons:\n* Web proxies may not necessarily support the WebSockets upgrade to the HTTP port protocol.\n* Tunneling non-HTTP and non-HTTPS traffic through ports 80 and 443 will circumvent firewall rules that may be in place for a larger reason. If you offer support for TCP tunneling by turning your web server into a network proxy, you may undermine standard security infrastructure, such as firewalls and secure gateways.\n* Data sent through tunneled TCP connections via WebSockets may not be securely transmittedâ€”particularly if the connection is sent via {{{ws://}}} rather than {{{wss://}}}. The WebSockets connection may not employ the same security and care as the standard TCP connection. This could expose the connection to eavesdropping or other exploits.\n\n==How To Check==\n\nTo verify that TCP connections are not tunneled via WebSockets:\n\n# **Find instances of code that uses WebSockets.** Look for instances where a WebSocket is created, such as: {{{var socket = new WebSocket(url);}}}\n# **Review the code to ensure the code is not used for tunneling TCP connections.** Look for any code that uses a port that is not 80 or 443. Also look for code that uses TCP sockets, such as the //Socket// object.\n\n==How To Fix==\n\nPerform a thorough review of your applications and remove instances of TCP tunneling if you find any in the review. To perform the review, follow these steps:\n\n# **Find instances of code that uses WebSockets.** Look for instances where a WebSocket is created, such as: {{{var socket = new WebSocket(url);}}}\n# **Review the code to ensure the code is not used for tunneling TCP connections.** Look for any code that uses a port that is not 80 or 443. Also look for code that uses TCP sockets, such as the {{{Socket}}} object.\n# **Remove code that performs tunneling.** If you find any code that you suspect of TCP tunneling, remove the offending code from the application.\n# **If tunneling is necessary, replace the tunneling with secure techniques such as VPN (virtual private networking).** Use industry-standard mechanisms for providing access to required services. Define and implement access policies that use these mechanisms.\n\n==WebSocket Guidelines==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000869806|Validate Data Coming from WebSockets]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000093dea4|Check the Origin Header in the WebSocket Handshake]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005f2e4a|Use TLS to Encrypt WebSocket Connections]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000736a21|Check the Origin Attribute of WebSocket Messages]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005326a8|Use the Latest WebSocket RFC 6455 Standard]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000085bc2f|Do Not Tunnel TCP via WebSockets]]\n\n==WebSocket Checklist Items==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000086537e|Data Coming from WebSockets Is Validated]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000077e316|The Origin Header in WebSocket Handshake is Checked]]\n* [[bd870268-f104-4f6f-ba0d-6628dc34eb2a|TLS is Used to Encrypt WebSocket Connections]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002f39d7|The Origin Attribute of WebSocket Messages Is Checked]]\n* [[18d5564d-00a4-4afe-a853-707269df2566|Latest RFC 6455 Standard is Used]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000091ce5a|TCP Is Not Tunneled via WebSockets]]\n"
