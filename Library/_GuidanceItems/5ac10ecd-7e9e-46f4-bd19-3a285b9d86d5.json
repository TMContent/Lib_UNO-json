To fulfill the purpose of the system configuration standards, they should be applied when new systems are being\n configured.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Make sure that system configuration standards are available for all network device types. Designate staff to be responsible for configuring new systems. Instruct the staff responsible for configuring new systems to apply the system configuration standards\n when new systems are configured. Add a point to the information security policy stating that the system configuration standards must be applied when new systems are configured.</p>"
