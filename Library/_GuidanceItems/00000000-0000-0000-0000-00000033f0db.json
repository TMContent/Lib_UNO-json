          "==Applies To==\n\n* iOS applications that handle sensitive data.\n\n==What to Do==\n\nDo not log sensitive data.\n\n==Why==\n\nIf sensitive data is logged, it may be recovered by an attacker if the device is lost or compromised.\n\n==How==\n\nTo prevent logging of sensitive data:\n\n# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of all sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:\n#* Passwords\n#* Encryption keys\n#* Personal information\n# **Review logging code.** Identify code that generates log entries by searching for //NSLog()// function calls. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries. If necessary, rewrite this code in a way that does not log sensitive data. If //NSLog()// calls are necessary for debugging, they can be conditionally commented out using //#define// directives.\n\n"
