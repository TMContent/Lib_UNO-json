Some examples are:\n#* Passwords\n#* Encryption keys\n#* Personal information\n# **Review logging code.** Identify code that generates log entries by searching for references to the //Log// class. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo prevent logging of sensitive data:\n\n# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:\n#* Passwords\n#* Encryption keys\n#* Personal information\n# **Identify logging code.** Find all code that uses the //Log// class. \n# **Review logging code.** Examine logging code to make sure that it never includes sensitive data in log entries.\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* For more information about logging on Android, see http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/debugging-log.html\n* For more information about the //Log// class, see http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html\n* For a tutorial on Android logging, see http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/android/logcat_android-sdk/\n"
