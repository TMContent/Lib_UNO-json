Interview the staff assigned to the development environment to make sure their environment is separate from the production environment. Interview the\n staff assigned to the production environment to make sure that their environment is separate from the development environment. Examine the actual production and development environments to make sure they are separate.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>If a development environment does not exist already, create it. If a development environment has been a part of the production environment, remove all development elements from the production environment. The development staff should be separate from the\n people working in the production environment. The personnel working in the production environment should not be concerned with development tasks.</p>"
