Use a \"deny all\" setting to block all traffic that is not explicitly allowed.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>Denying unauthorized transmissions makes it more difficult for a potential attacker to successfully conduct an attack and extract sensitive information.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Identify network services necessary for business purposes. Implement a firewall configuration that reflects the ports and protocols used by the required network services. Add an explicit \"deny all\" statement to the firewall configuration or use an implicit\n \"deny after allow\" setting.</p>"
