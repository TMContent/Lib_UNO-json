A list of idle users can be retrieved using a simple PowerShell script. PowerShell is installed by default on Windows 2008 but has to be downloaded and\n installed on the earlier versions of the Windows Server Operating System. Download the script from the link at the bottom of this page and execute it to see a list of users that have been inactive for 90 days or more.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>If necessary, download and install PowerShell. Download the PowerShell script from the link at the bottom of this page. Uncomment the last line of the script to make the script disable the inactive accounts. Schedule the script to run automatically every\n day.</p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>To download PowerShell, please see \"Scripting with Windows PowerShell‚Äù at <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/powershell.aspx\">\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/powershell.aspx</a>. </li>\n    <li>To download the inactive account management script, please see \"List Users that have not Logged on in xxx days\" at\n<a href=\"http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/ScriptCenter/en-us/83d39949-3e22-45ef-aaba-3a4e17341c5e\">\nhttp://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/ScriptCenter/en-us/83d39949-3e22-45ef-aaba-3a4e17341c5e</a>.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"/article/101a5f93-cbae-4e29-804e-25a57b1011fa\">Formulate the User Authentication and Password Policies</a>\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
