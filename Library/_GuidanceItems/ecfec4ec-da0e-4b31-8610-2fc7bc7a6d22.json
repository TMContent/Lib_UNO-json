When using the \"deny all\" rule, set it after the rules that allow services necessary for business operations. If your firewall supports implicit \"deny after allow\"\r\n functionality, you may use it instead.</p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/b01167a3-95a9-4172-b366-d905ac2ac21e\">Configure the Firewalls for PCI DSS Compliance</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
