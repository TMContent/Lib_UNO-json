          "==What to Do==\r\n\r\nSign application updates.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nCryptographically signing applications assures that the application binary has not been tampered with and that it came from a trusted source. In practice, updates to iOS applications are distributed as full new versions rather than patches. iOS application updates have to be signed to run, just like entirely new applications have to be signed. \r\n\r\n==How==\r\n\r\nThe procedure for signing iOS application updates is the same as the procedure for signing iOS applications in general.\r\n\r\n==Code Integrity Guidelines==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002e3de4|Implement Code Integrity Checks]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000470103|Sign iOS Application Updates]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000986af1|Sign iOS Applications]]\r\n\r\n==Code Integrity Checklists==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002d9dac|Code Integrity Checks Are Implemented]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000892dc7|iOS Application Updates Are Signed]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000039db6a|iOS Applications Are Signed]]"
