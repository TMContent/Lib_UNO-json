Create a spreadsheet to list each piece of code that calls these functions.\r\n# **Verify that the user is asked for permission to use geopositioning.** Log in to the application and access the functions that require geopositioning. Take note of whether the application asks you for permission before using geopositioning.\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo ask the user for permission before calling geopositioning functions:\r\n\r\n# **Determine if the application uses geopositioning.** Search the application code for use of the getCurrentPosition and watchPosition functions to determine whether the application uses geopositioning. Create a spreadsheet to list each piece of code that calls these functions.\r\n# **Write a message asking the user for permission to use geopositioning.** If the application uses geopositioning functions, write a polite message explaining to the user the benefits of using them, and asking for permission to use these functions. \r\n# **Ask the user for permission to use geopositioning.** For each piece of code that uses getCurrentPosition and/or watchPosition functions, add code that displays the message from the previous step. Add a conditional statement that only executes code that uses getCurrentPosition and/or watchPosition functions if the user has granted permission to do so.\r\n\r\n==Privacy and Trust Guidelines==\r\n\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001de66c|Ask User Permission Before Using Geopositioning]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000364213|Ask User Permission Before Sending a Manifest]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003b92c3|Tell Users to Clear the Cache after Browsing Through Untrusted Networks]]\r\n\r\n==Privacy and Trust Checklist Items==\r\n\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006e3400|The User Is Asked for Permission Before Geopositioning]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000085555d|The User Is Asked for Permission Before Sending a Manifest]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003087b2|Users Are Told to Clear the Cache After Browsing Through Untrusted Networks]]\r\n\r\n"
