Keys and passwords that have been used previously should never be used again.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>Retiring old keys ensures that unauthorized disclosure of old keys by former employees does not facilitate a compromise.</p>\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\n  <p>Perform the following steps to make sure that old encryption keys are retired:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Examine policy.</strong> Review the key management procedures in the information security policy to make sure they include provisions for archiving and revocation of previously used encryption keys.\n</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Conduct interviews. </strong>Interview the responsible staff members to make sure that the key management procedures are implemented as stated.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Use the following steps to make sure that old encryption keys are retired:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Define procedures for managing old encryption keys.</strong> Define a procedure for archiving old encryption keys.
