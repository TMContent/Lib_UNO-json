The back-up storage facility should be secure to ensure that back-ups are available in the event\r\n of a disaster and that the back-ups are not compromised.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Choose a secure off-site back-up storage facility. One example of such a facility is a bank. Place the back-ups in the secure off-site storage facility. Delegate responsibility for reviewing the back-up storage facility's security at least once a year. A\r\n back-up storage location may be considered secure if it has the same or greater level of security as your company.</p>"
