Define responsibilities of team members. Organize the incident response team to monitor the centralized log center 24/7 and to have the capability to\n react to suspected compromises. This means the team must be organized&amp;nbsp;in shifts so that at least one person is monitoring the log server at any time. Make sure the rest of the team is easy to reach so that the staff who is monitoring can summon others quickly.\n Define communication strategies to be used by team members to talk to each other and for other employees to contact the incident response team. The communication strategies may involve cell phones, email, instant messaging, etc. Consider communications security\n and do not disclose sensitive information over public networks. Define procedures and delegate responsibilities for notifying payment brands and customers in the event of a suspected compromise. It may not always be required to notify the customers, but it\n is good to have procedures for this in place in advance.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Define incident response procedures. </strong>Define specific incident response procedures. These procedures should reflect your computing environment and involve the technologies you use. A good outline to define these procedures is:\n</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Place the entire company on full alert and isolate the system component, which is considered to be compromised.\n</li>\n        <li>The incident response team should investigate the quarantined component and examine the logs.\n</li>\n        <li>If malicious software is detected or there are signs of unauthorized changes to the system, payment brands and possibly customers should be notified.\n</li>\n        <li>The investigation may need to be escalated to use external resources, such as federal investigators or investigators sent by the payment brands. Predicting the course of a large-scale investigation is difficult, especially when external parties that are\n not under the command of the company are involved, therefore this stage of incident response does not need to be explicitly defined, but it may be helpful to mention the capability for this course of action.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Define recovery and continuity procedures.&amp;nbsp;</strong>These procedures should be specific to your environment and technologies, but they should include the following:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Fix the vulnerability that made the compromise possible before resuming business operations.\n</li>\n        <li>In the event that some component part&amp;nbsp;is compromised, such as wireless for example, it may be possible to shut off the affected component and carry on business operations. In the event of a large-scale compromise this may not be an option.\n</li>\n        <li>The recovery and continuity plans should include worst-case scenarios. </li>\n        <li>One method for ensuring continuity is to have a small-scale duplicate infrastructure that includes additional security features available for use while the main system is investigated. A smaller scale infrastructure is easier to secure - it should not be\n merely a clone of the main system, but a significantly hardened system that includes only the minimum features to assure business continuity.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Test the incident response plan. </strong>Test the incident response plan when performing the annual penetration test. Include this fact when documenting the penetration test.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Conduct training for the incident response team.</strong> Enroll the members of the incident response team in an information security-training program.\n<em>Security Innovation offers information security training services.</em></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Monitor alerts. </strong>Configure the log server or the IDS/IPS to send alerts to the members of the incident response team. Since there should be always at least one member&amp;nbsp;of the incident response team watching the log server, at least one person\n should be always available to respond to alerts. Give the members of the incident response team each other's contact information and contact information of other people and organizations that may be helpful, such as the local police, the insurance company,\n information security professionals, etc.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Update documentation and policy. </strong>Update the incident response plan when fixing vulnerabilities found during penetration testing or suspected compromises.&amp;nbsp;Update the incident response plan if advances in information security technologies\n demand it. Add a point to the incident response plan that requires the plan to be updated as a reaction to a suspected compromise or penetration testing. Add this same requirement to the information security policy.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
