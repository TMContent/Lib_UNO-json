The DMZ is the network segment that has Internet access and may handle incoming Internet traffic. There may be more than one DMZ.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>The DMZ is a defense-in-depth measure used to separate systems that are open to attacks from those that hold sensitive information. When a DMZ is implemented, even if the systems in the DMZ are compromised, the attacker does not have full access to the sensitive\r\n information.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Check the network diagram to ensure that a network segment is designated as the DMZ. Check that the physical network matches the network diagram.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Designate a network segment as the DMZ. Install and configure a firewall between the DMZ and the Internet. Install and configure a firewall between the DMZ and the internal network segment. Document the network.</p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>&amp;nbsp;For more information about setting up a DMZ, please see&amp;nbsp;<a href=\"/article/6b2b4e47-bd4e-4f94-88a4-bf5e0afa96ee\">Configure the Routers for PCI DSS Compliance</a></li>\r\n  </ul>"
