In the event of detecting an unauthorized wireless device, it is recommended to alert the staff, send personnel to look for the unauthorized\n wireless device (wireless devices have limited range, so it may be possible to physically locate the device), shut down the wireless network, change the wireless access keys after the staff has finished searching for the device, whether they find it or not.\n Express this action plan in writing and attach it as a point to the incident response plan in the security documentation.</p>"
