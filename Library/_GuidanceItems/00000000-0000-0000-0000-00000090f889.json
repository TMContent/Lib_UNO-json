          "==Applies To==\r\n* iOS applications that use URL handlers.\r\n\r\n==What to Check For==\r\n\r\nVerify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nURL handlers may be abused in Cross-Site Scripting attacks. If URL handlers are used for sensitive operations, such sensitive operations may be exploited in Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\r\n\r\n==How to Check==\r\n\r\nTo verify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations:\r\n\r\n# **Identify all URL handlers used by the application.** Examine the application .plist file for //URL Types// defined by the application. These //URL Types// correspond to URL handlers used by the application.\r\n# **Identify the operations associated with the URL handlers.** The developers should know what each //URL Type// is responsible for. \r\n# **Verify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations.** Examine each URL handler to decide whether it is safe to keep. \r\n# **Verify that URL handlers validate the origin of the URL request.** If a URL handler is necessary to the application, make sure the //openURL// method is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo avoid using URL handlers for sensitive operations:\r\n\r\n# **Identify all URL handlers used by the application.** Examine the application .plist file for //URL Types// defined by the application. These //URL Types// correspond to URL handlers used by the application.\r\n# **Identify the operations associated with the URL handlers.** The developers should know what each //URL Type// is responsible for. Consider each one and decide if it is safe to keep.\r\n# **Remove dangerous URL handlers.** Sometimes URL handlers are used for testing. Remove any URL handlers that may be too dangerous from the production release.\r\n# **Verify the origin of the URL request**. Use the //openURL// method to make sure the URL request came from within the application itself or from a trusted application for any remaining URL handlers.\r\n\r\n==Dangerous API Guidelines==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000081be72|Avoid Using URL Handlers for Sensitive Operations]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004a6201|Disable Parsing of External XML Entities]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000072e73d|Use Static Format Strings]]\r\n\r\n==Dangerous API Checklists==\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000090f889|URL Handlers Are Not Used for Sensitive Operations]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000036b1bf|Parsing of External XML Entities Is Disabled]]\r\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008ea142|Static Format Strings Are Used]]\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For more information about the //openURL// method, please see http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/UIApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html"
