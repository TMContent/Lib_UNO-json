          "==What to Do==\n\nUse TLS to protect the authentication process. \n\n==Why==\n\nSensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, hashes, and keys has to be transmitted during authentication. The communication channel should be encrypted to prevent this data from being intercepted.\n\n==How==\n\nTo protect authentication using TLS:\n\n# **Configure IIS to use TLS.** Get a valid certificate. Hosting service providers often sell valid TLS certificates. Install the certificate. Create an HTTPS binding for the site. A link in the \"Additional Resources\" section describes how to do this in detail.\n# **Enable //requireSSL// for Forms Authentication.** If your application uses Forms Authentication, edit the Web.config and set the //requireSSL// attribute to //true// for the //authentication// element, like so: <authentication mode=\"Forms\" requiressl=\"true\"></authentication>\n# **Enable TLS for all pages.** It's recommended to enable TLS for the entire site. Use the IIS Manager to require TLS for the entire site. The detailed instructions on how to do this are linked to at the bottom of this page.\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* For information about setting up TLS on IIS, see http://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis\n* For information about the //FormsAuthentication.RequireSSL// property, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.formsauthentication.requiressl.aspx\n"
