Ask them to demonstrate the wireless analyzer that is used.</p>\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\n  <p>Acquire a wireless analyzer. Train a staff member to use it by having him or her read the vendor's documentation and practice using the analyzer. Use of the analyzer varies by vendor, but detecting all active devices should not be difficult, and the technical\n support should be able to assist with this task if necessary.&amp;nbsp;Schedule the dates for the quarterly scans.&amp;nbsp;Have the trained staff member scan for all active wireless network devices with the analyzer and document the results. Compare the results of the scan\n to the list of authorized wireless network devices in the network documentation. If an unauthorized device is detected, alert the responsible staff and execute the incident response plan.</p>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For a list of wireless security tools, please see \"Wireless Security Tools\" at\n<a href=\"http://www.corecom.com/html/wlan_tools.html\">http://www.corecom.com/html/wlan_tools.html</a>.\n</li>\n    <li>For information about AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer, please see \"AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer\" at\n<a href=\"http://www.airmagnet.com/products/wifi_analyzer/\">http://www.airmagnet.com/products/wifi_analyzer/</a>.\n</li>\n    <li>For information about YellowJacket WiFi Analyzer, please see \"Yellowjacket\" at\n<a href=\"http://www.bvsystems.com/Products/WLAN/YJ-BAG/YJ-BAG.htm\">http://www.bvsystems.com/Products/WLAN/YJ-BAG/YJ-BAG.htm</a>.\n</li>\n    <li>For information about Fluke Networks OptiView, please see \"OptiView Portable Network Analyzer\" at\n<a href=\"http://www.flukenetworks.com/fnet/en-us/products/OptiView&amp;#43;Series&amp;#43;III&amp;#43;Integrated&amp;#43;Network&amp;#43;Analyzer/Overview.htm\">\nhttp://www.flukenetworks.com/fnet/en-us/products/OptiView&amp;#43;Series&amp;#43;III&amp;#43;Integrated&amp;#43;Network&amp;#43;Analyzer/Overview.htm</a>.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"/article/c3d8ad00-de1d-4938-a4cf-0cd8b71fef36\">Use a Wireless Analyzer</a>\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>"
