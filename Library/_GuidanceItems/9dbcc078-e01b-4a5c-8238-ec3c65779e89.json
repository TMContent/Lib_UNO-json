If the changes to the router configuration are lost, then the router may revert\r\n to an earlier, insecure state.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Refer to the vendor's documentation or tech support for detailed instructions on how to sync the current configuration with the start-up settings on your hardware. This should be very simple. Most routers configured with a web interface feature a button\r\n that saves the current settings as the start-up configuration, and some do it automatically when new settings are applied. This rule is really for routers configured using terminal commands, which may require a special command to save the current settings.\r\n Cisco IOS command for this is \"copy running-configuration startup-configuration\" or \"copy run start.\" Most routers that use web administration interfaces save the configuration as the start-up settings automatically.</p>"
