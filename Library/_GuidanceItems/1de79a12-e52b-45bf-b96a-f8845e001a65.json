Dynamic packet filtering is also known as stateful inspection.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Dynamic packet filtering makes sure that only packets that are parts of an actual transmission can pass through the firewall. Dynamic packet filtering prevents a potential attacker from sending custom packets to scan the network or performing network layer\r\n attacks.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Enable dynamic packet filtering on the Internet firewall. Refer to the firewall vendor's documentation or tech support for detailed instructions on enabling dynamic packet filtering on your firewall.</p>"
