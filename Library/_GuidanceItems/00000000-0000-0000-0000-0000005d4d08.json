          "==Applies To==\n\n* iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.\n\n==What to Do==\n\nUse server-side authentication.\n\n==Why==\n\nServer-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.\n\n==How==\n\nTo use server-side authentication:\n\n# **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication control as they pertain to your application:\n#* Enforcing password strength requirements.\n#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.\n#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.\n#* Using multi-factor authentication.\n#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.\n#* Using SSL/TLS to secure communications.\n#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.\n#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.\n# **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls such as authentication on the server, because an attacker could tamper with client-side security controls or disable them altogether. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. \n# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need an interface for managing authentication credentials, network code that communicates with the server using SSL/TLS, a token or some other means to maintain a session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.\n\n==Authentication Guidelines==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003cccf2|Change Root Passwords on Jailbroken Devices]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000067c695|Encrypt Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006598ea|Implement a Secure Password Reset Function]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006171ed|Throttle Authentication Attempts]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005d4d08|Use Server-side Authentication]]\n\n==Authentication Checklists==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000076b90c|Root Passwords Have Been Changed on Jailbroken Devices]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004ce47f|Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network Are Encrypted]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006b19fc|A Secure Password Reset Function Is Implemented]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000816c4a|Authentication Attempts Are Throttled]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002a3f4d|Authentication Is Implemented on the Server-side]]\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* For more information about authentication requirements, please see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet"
