          "==Applies To==\n\n*iOS applications that use XML documents.\n\n==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled.\n\n==Why==\n\nParsing external entities in XML documents may result in XML injection vulnerabilities.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled:\n\n# **Identify the XML parsing library used by the application.** There are two common libraries for parsing XML in iOS applications: //NSXMLParser// and //LibXML2//.\n# **Examine code that uses //NSXMLParser//.** Parsing of external entities is disabled by default in //NSXMLParser//. Search for the //setShouldResolveExternalEntities// option to make sure it is not used to enable parsing of external XML entities.\n# **Examine code that uses //LibXML2//.** Parsing of external entitites needs to be manually disabled in //LibXML2//. Search for the //xmlSetExternalEntityLoader// method of the //parser// class to make sure that it is declared in a way that prevents loading of external XML entities.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nThere are two common ways to parse XML in iOS: //NSXMLParser// and //LibXML2//. \n\n# **//NSXMLParser//.** Parsing of external entities is disabled by default in //NSXMLParser//. Don't explicitly enable parsing of external entities - avoid using the //setShouldResolveExternalEntities// option. \n# **//LibXML2//.** Parsing of external entitites needs to be manually disabled in //LibXML2//. To disable parsing of external entities, use the //xmlSetExternalEntityLoader// method of the //parser// class to set the external entity loader to a function that doesn't do anything.\n\n==Dangerous API Guidelines==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000081be72|Avoid Using URL Handlers for Sensitive Operations]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004a6201|Disable Parsing of External XML Entities]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000072e73d|Use Static Format Strings]]\n\n==Dangerous API Checklists==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000090f889|URL Handlers Are Not Used for Sensitive Operations]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000036b1bf|Parsing of External XML Entities Is Disabled]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000008ea142|Static Format Strings Are Used]]"
