Find code that is responsible for each piece of  cached data.\n# **Do not cache sensitive data.** Examine code that caches data to verify that sensitive data is not cached.\n# **Add code that removes cached data.** Wherever data is cached, make sure that there is also code to remove the data that has been cached.\n\n==Privacy Guidelines==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000561ff3|Do Not Cache Sensitive Data]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000007e1362|Do Not Log Location Data]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001dcb79|Do Not Log Sensitive Data]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000629cc3|Delete Cached Data after Use]]\n\n==Privacy Checklists==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003b2aca|Sensitive Data Is Not Cached]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006c27b2|Location Data Is Not Logged]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005a7753|Sensitive Data Is Not Logged]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000007c99a7|Cached Data Is Deleted after Use]]"
