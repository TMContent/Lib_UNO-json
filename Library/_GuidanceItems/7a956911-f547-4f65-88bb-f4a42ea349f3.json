Because of this, a third party solution has to be used, and it is simplest to comply with all logging\n PCI DSS requirements if all other logging functionality is delegated to the third-party solution. Typically, the third party solution builds on top of the native Windows logging facilities and adds the functionality necessary for PCI DSS compliance.</p>\n  <p />\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Perform the following actions to implement audit trails for system components in compliance with PCI DSS.</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Deploy a centralized log server.</strong> Install and configure a centralized log server by following the vendor's instructions. Configure the log server to send alerts to the incident response team. Configure the&amp;nbsp;centralized log server vendor&amp;nbsp;to\n log the following:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Access to Cardholder Data</li>\n        <li>Actions by Administrators </li>\n        <li>Access to Logs</li>\n        <li>Denied Access </li>\n        <li>Authentication </li>\n        <li>Initialization of Logs </li>\n        <li>System Management </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Integrate the log server with the computing environment. </strong>Configure all network devices that are compatible with the log server to send logs to the log server. Configure the IDS/IPS to send logs to the log server. Configure the anti-virus\n to send logs to the server. Add functionality to your custom sofware to send logs to the centralized log server.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Instrument your custom software.</strong> Add functionality to your custom sofware to send logs to the centralized log server. Configure your company's custom software to log the following:\n</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Access to Cardholder Data</li>\n        <li>Actions by Administrators </li>\n        <li>Access to Logs</li>\n        <li>Denied Access </li>\n        <li>Authentication </li>\n        <li>Initialization of Logs </li>\n        <li>System Management </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Mitigate the devices that are not compatible with the log server.</strong> Make a list of the devices that are incompatible with the log server and use this list daily to manually check and backup the logs on them. Consider replacing the incompatible\n devices with ones that are.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h1>Additional Resources</h1>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For information about RSA enVision, please see \"RSA enVision\" at <a href=\"http://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=3170\">\nhttp://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=3170</a>. </li>\n    <li>For information about ArcSight ESM, please see \"ArcSight ESM\" at <a href=\"http://www.arcsight.com/products/products-esm/\">\nhttp://www.arcsight.com/products/products-esm/</a>. </li>\n    <li>For information about the LogLogic log server, please see \"LogLogic\" at <a href=\"http://www.loglogic.com/\">\nhttp://www.loglogic.com/</a>. </li>\n    <li>For information about the TriGeo log server, please see \"TriGeo SIM\" at <a href=\"http://www.trigeo.com/\">\nhttp://www.trigeo.com/</a>. </li>\n    <li>For information about the NetIQ log server, please see \"System Management NetIQ\" at\n<a href=\"http://www.netiq.com/\">http://www.netiq.com/</a>. </li>\n    <li>For information about McAfee PCI Pro, please see \"McAfee PCI Pro\" at <a href=\"http://www.mcafee.com/us/enterprise/products/risk_and_compliance/pci_pro.html\">\nhttp://www.mcafee.com/us/enterprise/products/risk_and_compliance/pci_pro.html</a>.</li>\n  </ul>"
