One approach is to search code for the //HttpSession// keyword and then trace each //HttpSession// object throughout the code.\r\n# **Follow the progress of data values throughout a session and consider values that might be changed from another thread.** Make special note of atomic operations that must be executed together.\r\n\r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo ensure thread safety:\r\n\r\n# **Identify all //HttpSession// objects that may be modified by multiple threads.** Find all code that modifies //HttpSession// objects, which may be accessed by multiple threads. One approach is to search code for the //HttpSession// keyword and then trace each //HttpSession// object throughout the code.\r\n# **Use immutable objects as much as possible.** Using immutable objects is a sound practice for avoiding concurrency issues and should be used as much as possible. The specifics of using immutable objects are different for different applications.\r\n# **Use class methods and local variables data handling.** For each piece of code that modifies //HttpSession// objects, use thread-safe class methods and local variables if possible. \r\n# **Synchronize critical sections that must be executed as a single operation.** For complex operations on //HttpSession// objects, make sure that critical sections are synchronized.\r\n\r\n\r\n==Problem Example==\r\n\r\nA shopping cart has a Pay Now button that finalizes a purchase and charges the customerâ€™s credit card. An application that is not thread safe may allow for a user to double-click the button and charge the customer twice for the same transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n==Solution Example==\r\n\r\nSynchronized critical sections or immutable objects both can help prevent concurrency issues that might lead to simultaneous credit card transactions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For more information about using immutable objects, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/immutable.html\r\n\r\n"
