Identify all the computers that are involved in the transmission. Choose a strong encryption solution to secure the transmission. Some acceptable encryption\n solutions are VPN and TLS: </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>VPN.</strong> VPN can be used to create an encrypted tunnel to send cardholder data. VPN can be used for multiple applications and network devices simultaneously. VPN is overall the most flexible solution.\n</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>TLS.</strong> TLS is best used for transmitting data between a web client and a web server.\n</p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Install and configure a strong encryption solution on each involved computer to secure the transmission.</p>"
