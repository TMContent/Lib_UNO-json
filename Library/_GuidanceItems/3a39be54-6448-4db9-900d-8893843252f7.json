Neither outbound nor inbound traffic should be routable between the cardholder data environment and the Internet.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Denying the cardholder data environment Internet connectivity prevents the potential attacker from being able to conduct attacks against it.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Check the router and firewall configurations to make sure there are no port-forwarding rules or gateways that allow inbound connections directly to the cardholder data environment. Use built-in operating system tools (such as ping, traceroute, nslookup)\r\n to make sure that the cardholder data environment has no Internet access. </p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Remove any routes from the router configuration that allow Internet access to the cardholder data environment. Remove any port forwarding rules from the firewalls and/or routers that allow Internet access to the cardholder data environment. Repeat the How\r\n to Check processes to ensure that&nbsp;changes have not accidentally introduced Internet connectivity in the cardholder environment.</p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"/article/6b2b4e47-bd4e-4f94-88a4-bf5e0afa96ee\">Configure the Routers for PCI DSS Compliance</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
