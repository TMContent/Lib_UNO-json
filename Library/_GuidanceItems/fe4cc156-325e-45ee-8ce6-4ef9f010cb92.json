This applies to paper hard copies as well as to digital media.</p>\r\n  <h1>How</h1>\r\n  <p>Different companies opt for different security measures. Generally speaking, physical security involves security guards, surveillance operators, surveillance equipment, physical barriers, alarms, locks, and card-based access controls. If your company has\r\n lax physical security, consider adding layers of the above-mentioned security measures until physical security is considered satisfactory.</p>"
