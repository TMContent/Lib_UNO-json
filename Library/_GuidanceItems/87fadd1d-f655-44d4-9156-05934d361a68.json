Identify all the certificates and keys used to encrypt the transmissions. Verify that all the used keys and certificates are authorized by examining the certificates and keys and interviewing the issuing parties. Add\n all the used keys and certificates to the trusted certificates or keys list of each respective application, such as a web browser.</p>"
