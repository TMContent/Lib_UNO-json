Some disk encryption applications&nbsp;may not work on removable media, so this data may need to be encrypted separately.</p>\r\n  <h1>Why</h1>\r\n  <p>Encrypt the cardholder data on removable media to make sure that if the media falls into the possession of an attacker, the cardholder data will still be secure.\r\n</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Identify all removable storage media that has cardholder data on it. Attempt to access the data on such media without an encryption key. Check the information security policy to make sure it includes a requirement for encrypting the cardholder data stored\r\n on removable media.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Identify the types of removable storage media that are used to store cardholder data. Identify encryption applications that are compatible with each type of removable storage media. Install and configure the corresponding encryption application for securing\r\n the cardholder data on all removable media. Add a point to the information security policy that requires encrypting all cardholder data stored on removable media.</p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <a href=\"/article/40de7c85-0fdd-4894-a3a1-943d4316fb12\">Prepare the Data Retention and Disposal Policies</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
