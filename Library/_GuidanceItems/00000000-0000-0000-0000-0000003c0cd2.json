Make sure that any user data is passed through positive validation routines before being included in HTTP response headers.\n# **Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded.** Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is URL-encoded using the //HttpUtility.UrlEncode// method before being included in HTTP response headers.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo URL-encode data in HTTP Response headers:\n\n# **Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.** Search your code for calls to //HttpResponse.AddHeader// to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.\n# **Validate all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use positive validation routines to check all data that gets included in HTTP response headers.\n# **URL-encode all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use the //HttpUtility.UrlEncode// method to URL-encode data that gets includes in HTTP response headers.\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* For more information about the //HttpResponse.AddHeader// method, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpresponse.addheader(v=vs.110).aspx\n* For more information about the //HttpUtility.UrlEncode// method, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4fkewx0t.aspx"
