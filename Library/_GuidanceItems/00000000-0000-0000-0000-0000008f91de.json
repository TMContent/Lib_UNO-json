          "==Applies To==\r\n\r\n* ASP.NET\r\n\r\n==What to Check For==\r\n\r\nVerify that authentication is protected using SSL/TLS.\r\n\r\n==Why==\r\n\r\nSensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, hashes, and keys has to be transmitted during authentication. The communication channel should be encrypted to prevent this data from being intercepted.\r\n\r\n==How to Check==\r\n\r\nTo make sure that authentication is protected using SSL/TLS:\r\n\r\n# **Authenticate using a web browser.** Open the application with a web browser. Log in to the application. The browser should provide indication whether SSL/TLS is being used, usually in the URL bar. \r\n# **Examine the Web.config file.** Review the Web.config file and make sure that the //requireSSL// attribute is set to //true// for the //authentication// element, if your application uses Forms Authentication. \r\n\r\n==How to Fix==\r\n\r\nTo protect authentication using SSL/TLS:\r\n\r\n# **Configure IIS to use SSL/TLS.** Get a valid certificate. Hosting service providers often sell valid SSL certificates. Install the certificate. Create an HTTPS binding for the site. A link in the \"Additional Resources\" section describes how to do this in detail.\r\n# **Enable //requireSSL// for Forms Authentication.** If your application uses Forms Authentication, edit the Web.config and set the //requireSSL// attribute to //true// for the //authentication// element, like so: <authentication mode=\"Forms\" requiressl=\"true\"></authentication>\r\n# **Enable SSL for all pages.** It's recommended to enable SSL/TLS for the entire site. Use the IIS Manager to require SSL for the entire site. The detailed instructions on how to do this are linked to at the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\n==Additional Resources==\r\n\r\n* For information about setting up SSL on IIS, see http://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis\r\n* For information about the //FormsAuthentication.RequireSSL// property, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.formsauthentication.requiressl.aspx\r\n"
