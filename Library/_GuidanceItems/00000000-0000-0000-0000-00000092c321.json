The recommended way to disable development code in production releases is through //#define// and //#ifdef// compiler directives.\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nSelf-signed TLS certificates are not allowed by default. Do not allow them. Avoid using the //allowsAnyHTTPSCertificateForHost// method in production releases, because it allows self-signed TLS certificates. Do not use the //continueWithoutCredentialForAuthenticationChallenge// selector within the //didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge// delegate method of //NSURLConnection// objects, because it enables self-signed TLS certificates.\n\n==Communication Security Guidelines==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006aa5d9|Disable Self-signed TLS Certificates]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000060779f|Use TLS to Protect Communications]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000007db8fe|Use Strong TLS Configurations]]\n\n==Communication Security Checklists==\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000092c321|Self-signed TLS Certificates Are Disabled]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005faaf0|TLS Is Used to Protect Communications]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000006b67b3|Strong TLS Configurations Are Used]]"
