          "==Applies To==\n* Android applications that authenticate to a remote server.\n\n==What to Check For==\n\nVerify that authentication is implemented on the server-side.\n\n==Why==\n\nServer-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.\n\n==How to Check==\n\nTo verify that authentication is implemented on the server-side:\n\n# **Review authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as pertaining to your application:\n#* Enforcing password strength requirements.\n#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.\n#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.\n#* Using multi-factor authentication.\n#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.\n#* Using TLS to secure communications.\n#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.\n#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.\n# **Identify authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server.\n# **Review authentication code.** Examine authentication code to find where the actual security controls are implemented.\n# **Verify that authentication is implemented on the server.** Make sure that sufficient security controls to satisfy authentication requirements are implemented on the server-side.\n\n\n==How to Fix==\n\nTo implement authentication on the server-side:\n\n# **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as pertaining to your application:\n#* Enforcing password strength requirements.\n#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.\n#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.\n#* Using multi-factor authentication.\n#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.\n#* Using TLS to secure communications.\n#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.\n#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.\n# **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls, such as authentication on the server, because client-side security controls can be tampered with or disabled altogether on the client. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. \n# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need an interface for managing authentication credentials, network code that communicates with the server using TLS, a token or some other means to maintain a session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.\n\n==Authentication Guidelines==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000589e46|Encrypt Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002eb5bd|Implement a Secure Password Reset Function]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000002a1fe0|Throttle Authentication Attempts]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000081c795|Use Server-side Authentication]]\n\n==Authentication Checklists==\n\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000582050|Authentication Credentials Sent over the Network Are Encrypted]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000035726e|A Secure Password Reset Function Is Implemented]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000016d320|Authentication Attempts Are Throttled]]\n* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000029e0c4|Authentication Is Implemented on the Server-side]]\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n* For more information about authentication requirements, please see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet"
