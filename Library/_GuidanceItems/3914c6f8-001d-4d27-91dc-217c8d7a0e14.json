In the event of a compromise, the list of visitors provides a list of suspects.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Start a visitor's log, recording the following information for each visitor: the visitor's name, the firm represented, and the name of the employee authorizing access. One way of keeping a visitor log is to make a spreadsheet with columns for the required\n information, print it out, give it to the receptionist, and ask visitors to fill it out before granting them access.</p>"
