In the event of a compromise, the list of visitors provides a list of suspects.</p>\r\n  <h1>How to Check</h1>\r\n  <p>Examine the visitor log to verify that it exists and has information for at least the past three months. Review the visitor log to make sure it includes the following information about each visitor: the visitor's name, the firm represented, and the name\r\n of &amp;nbsp;the employee authorizing access. </p>\r\n  <h1>How to Fix</h1>\r\n  <p>Start a visitor's log, recording the following information for each visitor: the visitor's name, the firm represented, and the name of the employee authorizing access. One way of keeping a visitor log is to make a spreadsheet with columns for the required\r\n information, print it out, give it to the receptionist, and ask visitors to fill it out before granting them access.</p>\r\n  <h1>Related Items</h1>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <a href=\"/article/806bf97c-a749-4ad5-8e21-ec33bc377dc8\">Implement Physical Security Controls</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>"
