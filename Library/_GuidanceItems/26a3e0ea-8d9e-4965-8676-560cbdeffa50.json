Store the disk encryption keys securely, for example on removable media that is protected with strong access controls and physical security.</p>\n  <h1>Why</h1>\n  <p>Disk encryption should use its own authentication mechanism to make it more difficult for a potential attacker to get the encryption key, especially in the event of an insider attack.</p>\n  <h1>How</h1>\n  <p>Decide whether to use whole disk encryption. Identify a disk encryption application that uses its own secure authentication mechanism, such as a password or a key file. Install and configure the chosen disk encryption suite. Secure the disk encryption keys\n with strong access controls and physical security.</p>"
