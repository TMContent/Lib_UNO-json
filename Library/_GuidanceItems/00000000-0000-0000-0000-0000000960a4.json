          "## Applies To ##\r\n\r\n* PHP\r\n\r\n## Summary ##\r\n\r\nEncode untrusted user data that is going to be included in HTML output. It is recommended to encode user data right before displaying it in HTML contexts. Another option is to encode user data when it is stored.\r\n\r\nEncoding untrusted data before displaying it prevents Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n## Problem Example ##\r\n\r\nSimply rendering user data submitted as a post parameter is dangerous and will result in a reflected XSS vulnerability:\r\n\r\n\t<?php\r\n\techo $_REQUEST['data'];\r\n\t?>\t\r\n\r\n## Solution Example ##\r\n\r\nUse the htmlspecialchars() function to encode untrusted data before displaying it to prevent reflected XSS. Unfortunately, PHP has a limited built-in support for encoding functions, that essentially only support HTML and URL contexts. These are the two most common contexts, but it is a serious limitation that the developer has to be aware of. It is best to simply not include untrusted data in other contexts and that should be possible for most common applications.\r\n\r\n\t<?php\r\n\techo htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['data']);\r\n\t?>\t\r\n\t\r\n## Guideline ##\r\n\r\n* [Encode Untrusted Data in Output](9b0ef1a5-c143-4e64-81cc-9e02ccbd9fbd)"
