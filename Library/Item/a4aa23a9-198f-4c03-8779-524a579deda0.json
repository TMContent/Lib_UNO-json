Use a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm, such as Hash Message Authentication\r\n Code (HMAC). Apply this against the state or sensitive data that you have to expose, which can guarantee the integrity of the data - i.e., that the data has not been modified. Ensure that you use an algorithm with a strong hash function (CWE-328).</p>"
