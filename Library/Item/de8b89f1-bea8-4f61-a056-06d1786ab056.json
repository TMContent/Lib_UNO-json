          "<h2>Description</h2>\r\n  <p>The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information. The use of a non-standard algorithm is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm and compromise\r\n whatever data has been protected. Well-known techniques may exist to break the algorithm.</p>\r\n  <h2>Discussion</h2>\r\n  <p>If you are handling sensitive data or you need to protect a communication channel, you may be using cryptography to prevent attackers from reading it. You may be tempted to develop your own encryption scheme in the hopes of making it difficult for attackers\r\n to crack. This kind of grow-your-own cryptography is a welcome sight to attackers. Cryptography is just plain hard. If brilliant mathematicians and computer scientists worldwide can't get it right (and they're always breaking their own stuff), then neither\r\n can you. You might think you created a brand-new algorithm that nobody will figure out, but it's more likely that you're reinventing a wheel that falls off just before the parade is about to start.</p>\r\n  <h2>Detection</h2>\r\n  <p>The following detection methods for weak cryptographic algorithm vulnerabilities are available:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Automated Analysis.</strong> Automated methods may be useful for recognizing commonly-used libraries or features that have become obsolete. False negatives may occur if the tool is not aware of the cryptographic libraries in use, or if custom cryptography\r\n is being used.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Manual Analysis.</strong> This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.\r\n These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h2>Mitigation</h2>\r\n  <p>The following mitigation methods for weak cryptographic algorithm vulnerabilities are available:</p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Use strong cryptographic algorithms.</strong> Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and select well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be\r\n available for analysis. For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification. When you use industry-approved techniques, you need to use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (CWE-325). These steps are often\r\n essential for preventing common attacks.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Do not develop your own cryptographic algorithms.</strong> They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If your algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how\r\n it works, then it is especially weak.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Periodically ensure that you aren't using obsolete cryptography.</strong> Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms\r\n that were once regarded as strong.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Design your software so that you can replace one cryptographic algorithm with another.</strong> This will make it easier to upgrade to stronger algorithms.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys (see CWE-320).</strong> If the keys can be guessed or stolen, then the strength of the cryptography itself is irrelevant.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Use a secure framework.</strong> Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Industry-standard implementations will save you development time and may\r\n be more likely to avoid errors that can occur during implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Consider the\r\n<em>ESAPI Encryption</em> feature.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <h2>Additional Information</h2>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>For more information about weak cryptographic algorithm vulnerabilities, please see\r\n<a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html#CWE-676\">http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html#CWE-676</a></li>\r\n  </ul>"
