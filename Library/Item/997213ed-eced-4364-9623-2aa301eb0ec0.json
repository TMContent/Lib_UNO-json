These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Limit access to the back-end.</strong> The passwords or keys should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Time-stamp messages.</strong> The messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay-style attacks.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>"
