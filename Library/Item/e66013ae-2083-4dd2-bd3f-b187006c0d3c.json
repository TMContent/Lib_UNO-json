          "<h2>What to Do</h2>\n  <p>Understand your programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation (CWE-681). Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between\n types, \"not-a-number\" calculations, and how your language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation. Also be careful to account for 32-bit, 64-bit, and other potential differences that may affect the numeric representation.</p>\n  <h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information about \"CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\", please see\n<a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/681.html\">http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/681.html</a></li>\n  </ul>"
