          "<h2>Description</h2>\n  <p>The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.</p>\n  <h2>Discussion</h2>\n  <p>In countless action movies, the villain breaks into a high-security building by crawling through heating ducts or pipes, scaling elevator shafts, or hiding under a moving cart. This works because the pathway into the building doesn't have all those nosy\n security guards asking for identification. Software may expose certain critical functionality with the assumption that nobody would think of trying to do anything but break in through the front door. But attackers know how to case a joint and figure out alternate\n ways of getting into a system.</p>\n  <h2>Detection</h2>\n  <p>The ways to identify missing authentication for critical functions are:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Manual Analysis.</strong> This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.\n Specifically, manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of custom authentication mechanisms. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business\n rules.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Automated Static Analysis.</strong> Automated static analysis is useful for detecting commonly-used idioms for authentication. A tool may be able to analyze related configuration files, such as .htaccess in Apache web servers, or detect the usage\n of commonly-used authentication libraries. Generally, automated static analysis tools have difficulty detecting custom authentication schemes. In addition, the software's design may include some functionality that is accessible to any user and does not require\n an established identity; an automated technique that detects the absence of authentication may report false positives.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h2>Mitigation</h2>\n  <p>The methods for mitigating missing authentication for critical functions are:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Separate the site into secure and public areas.</strong> Divide your software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.\n Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that\n is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated\n party will connect to the port. In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Use server-side security controls.</strong> For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying\n values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Use a secure framework.</strong> Where possible, avoid implementing custom authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These may make it easier\n to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks. In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of\n those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly. Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness\n easier to avoid. For example, consider using libraries with authentication capabilities such as\n<em>OpenSSL</em> or the <em>ESAPI Authenticator</em>.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <h2>Additional Information</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>For more information about missing authentication for critical functions vulnerabilities, please see\n<a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html#CWE-306\">http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html#CWE-306</a></li>\n  </ul>"
